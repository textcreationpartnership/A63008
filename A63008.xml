            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Which is endeavour'd to be evinc'd from the ſeveral things to which a Sacrament relates, the <hi>manner</hi> of its rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to each of them, and the <hi>foundation</hi> of that relation. The <hi>things,</hi> to which a Sacrament relates, ſhewn in the general to be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, or Divine, more particularly, divine Graces, and humane Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that New Covenant, which connects them together, and that body of men, which is confederated by it.

<pb facs="tcp:56517:4"/>relates in the <hi>nature</hi> of a ſign, a means of conveyance, and a pledge; To the ſecond in the <hi>nature</hi> of a ſimple ſign, or declaration, and (by means of that Covenant, which it conciliates) as an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them; To the third in the <hi>nature</hi> of ſuch a ſign, as ſerves alſo to give being to, or renew it; And to the fourth, and laſt in the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of a Diſcriminative ſign, or badge, and as a means of bringing particular men into it, or continuing them in it. The <hi>foundation</hi> of all theſe relations ſhewn to be the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of Chriſt, as that again, not ſo much as delivered by him, as applied to thoſe elements, in which they are ſubjected, by a declaration of the purport of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and by doing ſuch other things to them, as either the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral precepts of Chriſtianity, or the more particular precepts of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution oblige to the performance of.

For till that time there had been nothing but a Sacrament, and when they were met together by Tens, or by Hundreds, the Horſemen, who met by Tens, and the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who met by Hundreds, did, of their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per motion, take an Oath among themſelves, that they would not depart out of fear, or cowardice, nor quit their ranks at any time, unleſs it were to take up their Weapon, to dart at, or ſtrike the Enemy, or to ſave a Citizen. But that which proceeded at firſt from a voluntary Covenant among themſelves, was by the Tribunes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a preſcribed, and impoſed Oath,</hi> and the Souldiers forc'd to take it from them. Where we have not only the word <hi>Sacrament</hi> ſet to denote a <hi>Souldier's Oath,</hi> but <hi>ſuch</hi> an <hi>Oath,</hi> as was <hi>voluntarily</hi> taken by them, and had rather their own free conſent, than the Command of their General to give being to it. But as we find by the ſame paſſage, that what was at firſt but voluntary, came afterwards to be impoſed upon the Souldiers; ſo we find alſo that the word <hi>Sacrament</hi> came afterwards to ſignifie thoſe <hi>impoſed</hi> Oaths, as well as the former <hi>voluntary</hi> ones. For thus it is plain, <hi>Cicero</hi>

                     <p>But becauſe whatever the uſual ſenſe of the word <hi>Sacrament</hi> might antiently be, yet it is certain that it did not receive that ſenſe from the <hi>literal</hi> notation of it, but rather from ſomething of <hi>Sacredneſs,</hi> wherewith thoſe Oaths were attended: And becauſe the diſcovery of that <hi>Sacredneſs</hi> may help yet more to diſcover the true nature of thoſe <hi>Sacraments</hi> of ours, to which that name is now applied; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore enquire we in the next place what there was in them of <hi>Sacred</hi> to occaſion that denomination of them. Now as <hi>Sacred</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe than what tends to the honour of God, whether in its own nature, or by inſtitution; ſo there were two things of that quality in thoſe Oaths, whereof we ſpeak, and from whence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may be ſuppos'd to have receiv'd that denomination. Firſt their being in themſelves an acknowledgment of Gods glorious
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56517:7"/>Attributes, and particularly of his Knowledge, Truth, Juſtice, and Power; He who appeals to God as a Witneſs, and a Judge (as every man, that ſweareth doth) implying his believing him to be a competent witneſs, and ſo both Knowing, and True, and one too, who both can, and will aſſert the cauſe of truth in the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the party ſwearing, if he ſwear any other, than what he intends, or means.

The reſult of the premiſes is this; The word <hi>Sacrament,</hi> in its <hi>Original</hi> intendment, had the ſignification of a <hi>Military Oath,</hi> it had the ſignification of <hi>ſuch</hi> a Military Oath, as was attended with <hi>Sacred Rites,</hi> and ſuch as led men by ſenſible reſemblances to things of a higher nature. But whether or no, and how far it is to be look'd upon as of the like ſignification, in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> intendment of it, doth not as yet appear, but will be worth our labour to enquire.</p>
                     <p>Now that the word <hi>Sacrament,</hi> in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> intendment of it, is to be look'd upon as of like ſignification to what it had before ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd, will appear if we conſider <hi>firſt,</hi> what footing the former ſignification had gotten in the minds of men, before there was any appearance of the latter. For as conſidering the footing the former ſignification had gotten, we cannot but think that it would be apt to ſuggeſt it ſelf, as oft as the word <hi>Sacrament</hi> was made uſe of; ſo neither therefore but that it would form a like conceit of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Sacraments, and conſequently, if that were ſuch, an erroneous one. Which it being not to be thought, that they would give oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to, who firſt appli'd the word to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Sacraments; eſpecially when they might have had other words to expreſs their conception of them: It is but reaſonable to think that they made uſe of it upon occaſion of ſome likeneſs between the one and the other Sacraments, and conſequently that they intended it a like ſignification with the other.

But beſide the footing that ſignification of it had gotten, and by which therefore we may reaſonably imagine, that the firſt Chriſtians gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themſelves in the uſe of the ſame word in Chriſtianity, it is as certain that the ſame perſons, led thereto by the language of the Scripture, did both conceive of, and repreſent the <hi>life,</hi> and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Chriſtian under the notion of a <hi>Military</hi> one. For if ſo, it is yet more reaſonable to think, that they made uſe of their <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to expreſs ſome of their own Inſtitutions by.

For theſe, and other expreſſions of the like nature, ſhow plainly enough, that even the Penmen of the New Teſtament had that opinion of a Chriſtian
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56517:8"/>State, and that accordingly they repreſented it under the notion of a <hi>military</hi> one. The like evidence there is of their opinion of it, who took upon them to hand down that doctrine, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from the other: Witneſs <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s repreſenting the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in general as the <hi>Militia</hi> of God<note n="(o)" place="margin">De orat. c. <hi>14.</hi>
                        </note>, and affirming the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> that were in uſe among them, to have had their original from the <hi>Military</hi> ones; His repreſenting that Souldier, who refuſed to put on his Crown, as <hi>more the Souldier of God</hi>

The only thing to be farther enquired into is <hi>how far</hi> this likeneſs of ſignification may be ſuppoſed to prevail in the divine or Chriſtian intendment of it.</p>
                     <p>And here in the firſt place it is eaſie to obſerve, that the word <hi>Sacrament,</hi> in the Chriſtian intendment of it, did equally imply the thing, to which it was attributed to lay an <hi>Obligation</hi> upon him, that took it, to intend thoſe things, to which it related. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that otherwiſe it could have had little affinity with the <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> Sacrament, the principal deſign whereof was to lay an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56517:9"/>upon thoſe, that took it; The firſt time we find any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of a Chriſtian Sacrament, we find mention alſo made<note n="†" place="margin">Plin.

I add thirdly, as no leſs evident from the premiſes, the ſame words implying the things, to which it was attributed, to oblige the party, that took them, to be faithful to their General Chriſt, and who was the Captain, as well as the Author of our Spiritual warfare. As is evident, among other things, from <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s making the divine Sacrament to be accompanied with a profeſſion of our obedience unto <hi>Chriſt our Maſter,</hi> and accordingly arguing from thence the unlawfulneſs of taking upon us the <hi>Military</hi> one, and ſo <hi>anſwering to another Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> after him. I ſay Fourthly, that as the <hi>Military</hi> Sacrament did, among other things, oblige the party, that took it, to the avoiding of ſeveral things, which were inconſiſtent with the orderly management of an Army, and particularly to the avoiding of <hi>theft,</hi> and other ſuch like <hi>injuſtices,</hi> as appears by the form of it in <hi>Gelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>

                        <p>A Sacrament ſhewn to be a <hi>Relative</hi> thing, more particularly ſuch a Relative thing, as hath the relation of an <hi>outward, and viſible ſign</hi> of that, of which it is a Sacrament.

Which is endeavour'd to be evinc'd from the ſeveral things to which a Sacrament relates, the <hi>manner</hi> of its relation to each of them, and the <hi>foundation</hi> of that relation. The <hi>things,</hi> to which a Sacrament relates, ſhewn in the general to be Sacred, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, more particularly, divine Graces, and humane Duties, that New Covenant, which connects them together, and that body of men, which is confederated by it. To the firſt of which a Sacrament relates in the <hi>nature</hi> of a ſign, a means of conveyance, and a pledge; To the ſecond in the <hi>nature</hi> of a ſimple ſign, or declaration, and (by means of that Covenant, which it conciliates) as an Obligation to them; To the third in the <hi>nature</hi> of ſuch a ſign, as ſerves alſo to give being to, or renew it; And to the fourth, and laſt in the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of a Diſcriminative ſign, or badge, and as a means of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particular men into it, or continuing them in it.

But neither the one, nor the other will hinder us from diſcovering, under what <hi>head</hi> of things to place it, which is that we are firſt of all to intend. For whether we conſider a Sacrament, as to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or to <hi>our ſelves,</hi> as a means in his hands to profit us, or in ours to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare our piety toward him; Whether again we conſider it, in the hands of Chriſt, as a means whereby he <hi>ſignifies,</hi> and <hi>ſeals</hi> his own graces, or as a means whereby he <hi>conveys,</hi> as well as either <hi>ſignifies,</hi> or <hi>ſeals</hi> them; Yet ſtill it will be found to be in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>relative</hi> things, or ſuch, whoſe very being conſiſts in the reſpect they bear unto another: Becauſe, whatever it may be in it ſelf, yet it is not conſidered as ſuch, but with reſpect to that <hi>Grace</hi> of Chriſt, which it ſo ſignifies, or ſeals, or exhibits, or with reſpect to that piety, which it is intended on our part to declare. But ſo the Scriptures themſelves will oblige us to conſider a Sacrament, as is evident from what they teach concerning Baptiſm, and the Lord's Supper, which are, if not the only, yet the moſt undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sacraments of our Religion. For, agreeably thereto, they prompt us to conſider the water of Baptiſm<note n="(b)" place="margin">1 Pet. 3.21.</note>, not <hi>as putting away the filth of the Fleſh</hi> (which is the proper conſideration of water, as ſuch) but as <hi>waſhing us from</hi>

                        <hi>of it.</hi> For well may we look upon thoſe things as <hi>relative</hi> ones, which we are not only forbidden to conſider in their natural properties, but prompted to attribute to them the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of others, yea to conſider in the ſame notion with them. I ſay ſecondly, that as a Sacrament is a <hi>relative</hi> thing, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be reputed as the remote <hi>Genus</hi> of it, ſo it is of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>thoſe</hi> relative ones, which are <hi>ſigns,</hi> or <hi>repreſentations</hi> of what they ſo relate unto. As is evident in part from what we
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56517:10"/>were before taught concerning the water of Baptiſm, and will be yet more, when I come to ſhew the Analogy there is between the elements of each Sacrament, and that, to which they do relate. For if the water of Baptiſm, (though not to be conſidered as to any proper purification, yet) is to be conſidered under the notion of a <hi>Laver</hi>
                        <note n="(h)" place="margin">Tit. 3 5.</note>, and accordingly as <hi>waſhing</hi>
                        <note n="(i)" place="margin">Act. 22.16.</note> thoſe who are ſprinkled with it, from their ſins, then ought it to be look'd upon under the notion of a <hi>ſign</hi> of that, to which it doth ſo relate. Becauſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever force the Baptiſmal water may have toward the doing away our ſins, yet it cannot be ſuppoſed, becauſe ſin is no corporal ſpot, to waſh us from them; And that term of <hi>waſhing</hi> therefore attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to it upon the account of the Analogy there is between the property of water conſidered in its own nature, and that of the ſame water as conſecrated into a Sacrament. Which will conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently make the water of Baptiſm, (and, by proportion thereto, the elements of other Sacraments) not only to have a relation to ſomething of another nature, but alſo to be a <hi>ſign,</hi> or repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. I ſay nothing at preſent of a Sacrament's being a <hi>means of conveying</hi> ſomething to us, as well as a <hi>ſign</hi> of it, and a <hi>pledge to aſſure</hi> us of it, as well as either; Partly, becauſe that, which hath the nature of a <hi>ſign,</hi> may alſo be made uſe of as a <hi>means</hi> of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, and a pledge; And partly becauſe the firſt intention of a Sacrament is to ſignifie that, of which it is ſo, and that therefore by which it comes to do ſo, more commodiouſly aſſigned as the <hi>Genus</hi> of it. And I ſhall only add, that foraſmuch as a <hi>ſign</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, than that, <hi>which offers it ſelf</hi> to the <hi>ſenſes,</hi> and <hi>that,</hi> of which it is a ſign, <hi>to the</hi> underſtanding; Foraſmuch therefore as it muſt be ſubjected in ſome ſenſible being, and (if it be alſo a formal ſign, or that which repreſents the thing, of which it is ſo) in ſuch a being, as is apparent to the eyes; Foraſmuch laſtly as Baptiſm, and the Lord's Supper (which are, at leaſt, the moſt conſiderable Sacraments of our Religion) are ſubjected in ſuch ſenſible, yea viſible beings; It cannot but be deemed reaſonable, for the more clear declaring of the nature of a Sacrament, to repreſent it (as our <hi>Catechiſm</hi> doth) as an <hi>outward, and viſible</hi> one.</p>
                     <p>That therefore being to be looked upon as the <hi>Genus</hi> of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, or that general head of things, under which we are to conceive of it; Enquire we in the next place after the <hi>eſſential at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes</hi> thereof, and by which it will not only be more perfectly known what it is, but alſo be more clearly diſcriminated from thoſe things, which are of the ſame general nature. Now as the eſſence of a relative thing conſiſts in the relation it bears to another, and that relative thing therefore, whereof we ſpeak, in the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which it bears to that, of which it is a ſign; So the eſſential attributes of a Sacrament cannot therefore be better learned, than by the knowledge of <hi>thoſe things,</hi> to which it doth relate, the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of its relation to them, and the <hi>foundation</hi> of it.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. In the <hi>general</hi> I obſerve, that that, to which a Sacrament re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, muſt be ſomething <hi>Sacred,</hi> or <hi>Divine,</hi> as both the term of <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and the known nature of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and the Lord's Supper perſwade. Which is the rather to be remarked, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56517:11"/>it from ſuch <hi>ſigns,</hi> as relate to <hi>civil</hi> matters, and particularly from the purely <hi>military</hi> Sacrament. For though even that had a relation to God, as whoſe name it did invoke, and to whoſe truth, and juſtice it did appeal; yet it referr'd to God rather as a <hi>witneſs</hi> of what it affirmed, than as to the <hi>object</hi> of it.

                     <p>I obſerve more particularly, that as that may be termed Sacred, or Divine, which hath God either for its principle, or object, and accordingly <hi>flows from him to us,</hi> or <hi>paſſeth from as to him;</hi> ſo a Sacrament relates both to the one, and the other, and ought to be looked upon as ſuch. That a Sacrament relates to that, which <hi>flows from God to us,</hi> is a thing neither denyed, nor forgotten by any, and is evident from what the Scriptures teach concerning Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, and the Lord's Supper.

                        </note> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a more particular account of. For if, as that Apoſtle inſinuates, and hath accordingly been more largely confirmed, the <hi>ſtipulation or anſwer of a good conſcience toward God</hi> be a conſiderable part of Baptiſm; If it be ſo conſiderable a part of it, as to give it much of that <hi>ſavingneſs</hi> which it hath; Then muſt that Sacrament be thought (becauſe the ſtipulation of a good Conſcience is of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) to relate to ſomething, that muſt come from us, as well as to thoſe things, which flow from God to us. It is true indeed that our Church, where it ſets it ſelf to define a Sacrament, takes no notice of this object of it; Whether it were through a ſimple inadvertency, and from which our Church doth no where pretend it ſelf to be free, or (which I rather think) that it might give ſo much the more particular an account of that other, and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable object of it, even that inward, and Spiritual Grace, which
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56517:11"/>it was intended to ſignifie, and exhibit, and aſſure. For that our Church did not wholly forget this ſecond object of a Sacrament (even that duty, and ſervice of ours, which it doth equally ſignifie, and prompt us to declare) is evident from its before minding the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumen of his Baptiſmal vow<note n="(ſ)" place="margin">Prelim. Queſt. and Anſw. of the Cat.</note>, and from the declaration it elſewhere<note n="(t)" place="margin">Office of Publ. Bapt.</note> makes, that they who are to be baptized muſt alſo <hi>for their parts</hi> promiſe the renouncing of the Devil, and his works, and both Faith and Piety toward God: That, as it ſhews her to have looked upon Baptiſm as a <hi>federals rite,</hi> or ceremony, ſo that ſhe equally believed it to relate to our duty, and ſervice, as well as to thoſe divine benefits, we receive from the Author of it. Let it remain therefore for an undoubted truth, and the acknowledged Doctrine of our Church, that a Sacrament relates as well to what is to <hi>paſs from us to God,</hi> as to what is to <hi>come from God to us,</hi> and that accordingly it may be ſo far forth defined, ſuch an outward, and viſible ſign, whereby we make a declaration of our piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God, as Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>
                        <note n="(u)" place="margin">Inſtit. li. 4. c. 14. §. 1.</note> hath very well obſerved.</p>
                     <p>I may not forget to add, for the farther clearing of this head, that as a Sacrament relates firſt, and chiefly to that, which <hi>paſſeth from God to us;</hi> ſo we are to conceive of that, to which it ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, under the notion of a <hi>Grace given unto us,</hi> yea of <hi>an inward, and ſpiritual one.</hi> That we ought to conceive of it under the notion of <hi>a grace given unto us,</hi> is evident from thoſe Texts, which I but now made uſe of to ſhew, that a Sacrament relates to <hi>that</hi> which <hi>paſſeth from God to us.</hi> For inſtancing in ſuch things, as have the nature of <hi>benefits,</hi> and, ſo far forth therefore, are to be looked upon as <hi>Graces,</hi> or <hi>Favours,</hi> inſtancing moreover in ſuch benefits, as are manifeſtly <hi>the iſſues of the Divine Goodneſs,</hi> yea which the Scripture expreſly affirms to be <hi>given</hi> to us by him (for ſo it doth as to that<note n="(w)" place="margin">Luk. 22.19.</note> 
                        <hi>Body of Chriſt,</hi> which is the foundation of them all) they muſt conſequently oblige us to conceive of that, to which a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament relates, as a <hi>Grace given unto us.</hi> But neither will there be leſs evidence from thence, if thoſe Texts be well conſidered, that that <hi>Grace,</hi> to which a Sacrament relates, <hi>is an inward and Spiritual one.</hi> For as our Church means no other by an <hi>inward and Spiritual Grace,</hi> than that which conduceth in an eſpecial manner to the welfare of our inward man, or Spirit, (as is evident from its making the <hi>Body and Blood of Chriſt</hi> the inward, and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Grace of the Lords Supper, and which it cannot be in any other ſenſe, than that it hath ſuch an effect upon us) ſo the Texts before alledged attribute ſuch Graces to the Sacraments, as are, in that ſenſe at leaſt, <hi>inward and Spiritual ones:</hi> Witneſs their attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to them the Graces of <hi>regeneration, and forgiveneſs,</hi> which are as it were the formal cauſes of our welfare, and the grace of <hi>Chriſts Body, and Blood,</hi> which is the meritorious cauſe thereof, and under God, and by his acceptation, in the place of an Efficient alſo.</p>
                     <p>I obſerve farther, that as a Sacrament relates to ſuch things, as have the nature of divine <hi>Graces,</hi> or <hi>humane duties;</hi> ſo thoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and duties being parts of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> and receiving all their force from it, a Sacrament muſt conſequently relate to that <hi>New Covenant,</hi> to which they do belong, and from which they receive all their force. Of which yet if there remain any doubt, it
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56517:12"/>will not be difficult to clear it from what the Scripture aſſures us concerning Baptiſm, and the Lords Supper; St. <hi>Peter</hi>

Shall we then ſay, that Chriſt is the Mediator of the New Teſtament, becauſe interpoſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the maker of that Teſtament, and thoſe who are the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatees in it? But by this means God the Father ſhall become the Teſtator, which, if death be required to make him ſuch, he can by no means be. Shall we ſay laſtly, that Chriſt may be looked upon as a Mediator of the New Teſtament, becauſe by means of that Teſtament of his taking up the difference between God, and Man? But that is rather to make him a Mediator <hi>by a Teſtament,</hi> than <hi>of one,</hi> which Chriſt is here affirmed to be. So difficult will it be found to make any tolerable ſenſe of thoſe words, if we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand

For as that Covenant (and indeed all the kindneſs that paſſed between them) was brought about by the mediation of Sacrifices<note n="(c)" place="margin">Exo. 24.5.</note>, and the blood of thoſe Sacrifices therefore ſtiled <hi>the blood of the Covenant</hi>

                     <p>I will conclude what I have to ſay concerning thoſe <hi>things,</hi> to which a Sacrament relates, when I have taken notice of its relating to that <hi>body of men,</hi> with whom this New Covenant is made, as well as to the Covenant it ſelf. For that it doth ſo, we have the former inſtances of Baptiſm, and the Lord's Supper to aſſure us, or rather what we learn from the Scriptures concerning them: St. <hi>Paul</hi> giving us to underſtand, that it is into that <hi>body,</hi> that we are
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56517:13"/>baptized<note n="(l)" place="margin">1 Cor. 12.13.</note>, as, in like manner, that though <hi>we be many, yet we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come</hi> one bread, and that one body<note n="(m)" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.17.</note> by partaking of the <hi>bread</hi> of the other Sacrament.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. It appearing from the premiſes, what thoſe <hi>things</hi> are, to which a Sacrament relates, and the way therefore ſo far plained toward the diſcovery of the properties thereof, enquire we in the next place into the <hi>nature</hi> of that <hi>relation,</hi> which I have affirmed it to bear unto the other. For my more advantageous diſcovery whereof I will reſume each of thoſe <hi>things,</hi> to which it doth relate, and ſhew <hi>what kind of relation</hi> it beareth to them.</p>
                     <p>Now as the <hi>firſt</hi> of thoſe things is an <hi>inward and Spiritual Grace,</hi> that is to ſay, ſuch a one as conduceth in an eſpecial manner to the welfare of our inward man, or ſpirit; ſo we ſhall find a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, as to it, to have the nature of a <hi>ſign,</hi> or <hi>viſible repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> of it. A thing ſo acknowledged by all, by whom the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are acknowledged in any meaſure, that it will hardly be worth our while to inſiſt upon it. It may ſuffice here to ſay, that as a <hi>ſign</hi> is ſo much of the Eſſence of a Sacrament, that it is the very <hi>Genus</hi> of it, and muſt therefore be ſuppoſed to be <hi>ſuch,</hi> as to all thoſe things to which it relates; ſo we ſhall find the Sacraments of Baptiſm, and the Lord's Supper to repreſent even to our eyes thoſe inward and ſpiritual graces, which are attributed to them. For thus the <hi>water</hi> of Baptiſm doth by that <hi>cleanſing</hi> quality, which is natural to it, and which, as ſuch, is a repreſentation of that ſpiritual Grace, which <hi>purgeth</hi>
                        <note n="(n)" place="margin">Heb. 9.14.</note> 
                        <hi>the Conſcience from dead works,</hi> which are, as it were, the <hi>filth</hi>
                        <note n="(o)" place="margin">2 Cor. 7.1.</note>, and <hi>pollution</hi> of it. And thus too the Elements of the Lord's Supper do, as by other ways, and means, ſo by that which is done unto them; The <hi>breaking</hi> of the one ſerving to ſet forth the <hi>breaking of Chriſts body</hi> upon the Croſs, as the pouring out of the other doth the <hi>ſhedding</hi> of his blood at thoſe paſſages, which were made for it by the Nails, and Spear, that pierced him.</p>
                     <p>But beſide that a Sacrament hath the relation of a <hi>ſign</hi> to that inward, and ſpiritual Grace, which belongeth to it, it hath alſo the relation of <hi>ſuch</hi> a ſign, as is moreover an apt inſtrument to convey that grace, which is ſignified by it. I inſtance, for the proof hereof, in the Scriptures attributing ſuch effects to Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper, as are the immediate iſſues of thoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which are ſignified by them. For if it attribute ſuch effects to them, it muſt conſequently intimate them to be the conveyers of thoſe Graces, from whence they reſult, as which otherwiſe they could not be in a condition to produce. Now that the Scriptures attribute ſuch effects to the Sacraments before remembred, as are the immediate iſſues of thoſe graces, which are ſignified by them, will appear, as to <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> by their attributing to it a power of <hi>waſhing away</hi>
                        <note n="(p)" place="margin">Acts 22.16.</note> 
                        <hi>the ſins of men.</hi> For whether we underſtand thereby the waſhing away their <hi>guilt,</hi> or waſhing away the <hi>pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi> of them, we ſhall ſtill find it to be the immediate iſſue of an inward, and ſpiritual Grace; It being the blood of Jeſus Chriſt (as the Scriptures<note n="(q)" place="margin">Explic. of the Creed in the word <hi>Dead.</hi>
                        </note> every where declare) that waſheth us from ſin in the former ſenſe, and the ſanctifying Graces of God's ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit<note n="(r)" place="margin">Expl. of the Creed, in the words, <hi>I believe in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                        </note>, which <hi>purifie us from it</hi> in the other. If therefore the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56517:14"/>of Baptiſm may be ſaid ſo to <hi>waſh,</hi> and <hi>purifie,</hi> it muſt be as it is an Inſtrument, whereby it conveys to us thoſe graces, to which that purification doth belong. But ſo the ſame Scriptures do yet more expreſly declare, as to that other Sacrament of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, even the <hi>Supper of the Lord;</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> telling us<note n="(ſ)" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.16.</note> of the <hi>bread</hi> of it, that it is the <hi>Communion,</hi> or Communication <hi>of Chriſt's</hi> body, as of the <hi>Cup</hi> that goes along with it, that it is the <hi>Communion of his blood.</hi> For what other can we well underſtand by that <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion</hi> of his, than that they are an inſtrument, whereby God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys, and we accordingly come to partake of that body, and blood of Chriſt, which is ſignified by them? This only would be added, for the clearer Explication of it, that when were preſent the Sacrament as an inſtrument, whereby God conveys to us that grace, which is ſignified by it, we do not mean thereby that it is a <hi>natural</hi> one, or ſuch as contains that grace in it, as a Veſſel doth liquor, or a cauſe its effect, but rather (as the Judicious <hi>Hookes</hi>
                        <note n="(t)" place="margin">Eccl. Pol. li. 5. ſect. 57.</note> ſpeaks) as a <hi>moral</hi> inſtrument thereof; That is to ſay, as ſuch a one, to the uſe whereof God hath made a promiſe of his grace, and which accordingly he will accompany with the exhibition of the other.</p>
                     <p>I deny not indeed but there are, who are otherwiſe perſwaded, and who accordingly either attribute a greater efficacy to a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or deny even that, which we have attributed to it. Of the former ſort are they, who not contented to affirm that a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is an inſtrument, whereby God conveys grace to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receiver of it, do moreover repreſent it under the notion of a <hi>Phyſical</hi> one, yea of <hi>ſuch</hi> a Phyſical one, as contains grace in it, as a cauſe doth its effect, and accordingly contributes by its own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal force to the producing of it, as well as to the poſſeſſing us thereof. Even as a Chezil (for ſo they<note n="(u)" place="margin">Hiſt. of Counc. of <hi>Trent</hi> li. 2.</note> explain themſelves) contributes to the formation of a Statue, or as a Hatchet to that Bed,<note n="(w)" place="margin">Aquin. ſum. Part. <hi>3.</hi> Qu. <hi>62.</hi> Art. <hi>1.</hi>
                        </note> which is ſhaped by it. But as it appears by <hi>Aquinas</hi>
                        <note n="(x)" place="margin">Ibid.</note>, who was it may be the firſt framer of it, that that conceit had its original from the fear of making a Sacrament to be nothing but a <hi>bare ſign</hi> of grace, contrary to the opinion of the <hi>Holy Fathers;</hi> ſo nothing more therefore can be neceſſary toward the overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, than to ſhew the groundleſneſs of that fear, which the doctrine before deliver'd will ſufficiently evince. For if it be but a <hi>moral inſtrument,</hi> whereby God conveys his own graces, it is certainly more than a <hi>ſign,</hi> yea it may, in ſome ſenſe, be ſaid to be a cauſe, as well as the inſtrument thereof. For as they, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to a Sacrament the <hi>efficacy</hi> of a <hi>cauſe,</hi> make it to be no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a cauſe of grace, than that it produceth in the Soul a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition<note n="(y)" place="margin">Hiſt. of Counc. of <hi>Trent</hi> li. 2.</note> to receive it (by which means it is not ſo much the cauſe of grace, as of our receiving it) ſo ſuch a kind of cauſality will be found to belong to it, though we make a Sacrament to be no other than a means whereby we attain it: Becauſe it is ſo far forth by the force of a Sacrament, that grace comes to be in us, that without that we cannot ordinarily hope to attain it, nor fear to fail of it, where the other is duly receiv'd. The only diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as to this particular between the one, and the other opinion, is, that whereas the former makes a Sacrament to diſpoſe us to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56517:14"/>the reception of Grace, as well as to convey it; The latter ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that diſpoſition already produc'd, and conſequently leaves no place for the former operation. In that reſpect yet more agreeably to the Doctrine of the Scriptures, becauſe not only pre-requiring certain qualifications<note n="(z)" place="margin">Act. 8.36, 37. 1 Cor. 11.20.</note> of thoſe, that are to receive it, but aſſuring them, that if they come ſo qualifi'd, they ſhall not fail<note n="*" place="margin">Mark. 16.16. Act. 2.38.</note> of that grace, which the Sacrament was intended to convey; Theſe and the like aſſertions, as they ſuppoſe the Soul to be before diſpos'd, ſo leaving no place for any other cauſality in a Sacrament, than its ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to us as a means of conveying that grace, which we are ſo diſpoſed to receive. And indeed as it doth not appear by any thing that Schoolman hath alledg'd, that the Antients ever attributed any other cauſality to a Sacrament (for though St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> as he is quoted by him, affirms the power of God to work by a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, yet he doth not affirm it to do ſo as by a Phyſical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument) As it appears farther, even from that Schoolman, that St. <hi>Bernard</hi> was of opinion, that <hi>Grace is no otherwiſe conveyed by a Sacrament, than a Canonry</hi> in his time <hi>was by a Book, or a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick by Ring;</hi> ſo there is no defect in the Inſtances of that <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> ſuppoſing a Book or a Ring to have been as much a means of conveying of thoſe preferments, as we affirm a Sacrament to be of the divine Grace. For in that caſe the delivery of a Ring, or a Book, would not only have been a <hi>ſign,</hi> whereby the delivery of thoſe preferments was declar'd, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> argues in the place before, but a ceremony by which they were actually made over, and without which they could not have been Canonically inveſted in them. I conclude therefore, that if a Sacrament be an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Grace, it is a moral one, and ſuch as contributes no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther toward our partaking of it, than as it is a means to which God hath annex'd the promiſe of it, and which accordingly he will not fail (where the receiver is rightly diſpos'd) to accompany with the exhibition of the other.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe there are ſome, who are ſo far from owning a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to be a <hi>phyſical</hi> inſtrument of grace, that they will not ſo much as allow it to be a <hi>moral one;</hi> And becauſe ſuch a conceit may tend as much to the depretiating of a Sacrament, as the other ſeems to tend to the overvaluing of it; Therefore conſider we in the next place the pretenſions of thoſe, that entertain it, and the ſtrength, or rather weakneſs of thoſe pretenſions. There are who have thought (and it were to be wiſh'd that many more did not, who do not perhaps ſpeak it out) that a Sacrament, as to this particular is a bare ſign of the Divine Grace, and accordingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by God, only to awaken mens minds to conceive it, and their hearts to the embracing of it. What induced them ſo to opine, I am not able to ſay, unleſs it were, on the one hand an univerſal acknowledgment of its being a ſign; and a fear, on the other, leſt if they made it any thing more, they ſhould approach too near to thoſe exceſſes, into which the former had caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But as it is a very ill way of chooſing opinions in Religion by the diſtance, which they bear to the exceſſes of other men; ſo the fondneſs of this cannot better be made appear, than by thoſe glorious effects, which are attributed to a Sacrament, and which, in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56517:15"/>ſtrictneſs of ſpeech, are the proper, and immediate iſſues of that which is ſignified by it. For that which is only a <hi>ſign</hi> being no way capable of producing ſuch effects, nor therefore with any reaſon of having ſuch effects attributed to it, we are in reaſon, where the thing will bear it, to conceive it under ſuch a notion, as will make thoſe effects yet more proper to it. Which we ſhall then, and then only do, when we make it ſuch a ſign, whereby (as was before ſaid) God conveys to us that Grace, by which thoſe effects are produc'd. Only as there are, who think all this may be ſalv'd, by making a Sacrament a <hi>ſeal,</hi> as well as a <hi>ſign</hi> of Grace, or rather a ſeal of that <hi>New Covenant,</hi> by which we are intituled to it; ſo it may not therefore be amiſs to examine that pretenſion alſo, and enquire into the validity thereof. What relation a Sacrament bears to the New Covenant, and how far the notion of a ſeal is compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible to it, ſhall be examin'd in another place, and I will not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at preſent engage my ſelf in that diſpute. But I ſhall not ſtick to affirm, that how legitimate ſoever that notion of a Sacrament may be, yet it is no adequate one; As will appear in part from the inſufficiency of thoſe grounds upon which it is built, and in part alſo from the nature of that Covenant, whereof they ſpeak, and of which they repreſent it as a ſeal. For the evidencing the former whereof we are to know, that as the ground upon which it is built is a paſſage of St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <note n="(a)" place="margin">Rom. 4.11.</note>, where he repreſents the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of Abraham</hi> as a <hi>ſeal of</hi> that <hi>righteouſneſs of faith, which he had yet being uncircumcis'd;</hi> ſo that Text, if it be well examin'd, will not be found to be a ſufficient proof of that, for which it is alledg'd. For not to require thoſe that urge that Text (which yet they ſeldom do) to make it appear that the <hi>Chriſtian Sacraments</hi> are of the ſame nature with <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> and conſequently that what is ſaid concerning Circumciſion ought to be alike underſtood of the other; Neither is what is there affirm'd concerning Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion affirm'd concerning Circumciſion <hi>in the</hi> general, but only of the Circumciſion of <hi>Abraham,</hi> neither is it affirmed concerning his, that it was a ſeal of that Covenant, to which it did more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately relate, but of that righteouſneſs, which he had before he enter'd into it. Things, which if duly conſider'd, will render that teſtimony perfectly ineffectual, as to what it is deſigned to eſtabliſh. For as if <hi>Abraham</hi>'s caſe were different from that of other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed perſons, what may have been to him a ſeal of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Faith, may not yet have been ſuch to them; ſo that <hi>Abraham</hi>'s caſe was ſo far different from that of the generality of Circumciſed perſons, may appear from his having <hi>before</hi> had that righteouſneſs of Faith, which the other, becauſe Infants, could not be ſuppoſed to have had, or, at leaſt, not till they had it by the ſign of Circumciſion. And indeed, whoſoever ſhall conſider what the Apoſtles deſign in that place is, even to ſhew that the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Faith is not annexed to Circumciſion, becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> had it before he was Circumciſed, muſt conſequently believe that when he afterwards makes that Circumciſion of his a ſeal of that righteouſneſs in him, his meaning was only to ſay, that it was a teſtimony from God to him, and others, that he allowed of the former righteouſneſs, as which if he had not done, he would not
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56517:15"/>thus have entred with him into that other Covenant, of which Circumciſion was a ſign. By which way of arguing, what is here ſaid concerning Circumciſions being a <hi>ſeal,</hi> muſt not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of it, as it was in it ſelf, and ſo in a notion common to all that receiv'd it, but with reſpect to that righteouſneſs of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s, which it followed after in time, and which it could not but be look'd upon as ſome Confirmation from God of, becauſe a ſign of that New Covenant which God then enter'd into with him. As for that New Covenant, or any righteouſneſs of Faith accruing to <hi>Abraham</hi> by it; This St. <hi>Paul</hi> is ſo far from affirming his Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to have been a ſeal of, that he may ſeem rather to intimate, that it had no ſuch relation to it: Becauſe affirming it to have been a ſeal of that righteouſneſs, which he had before it, and which therefore he derived not from the Covenant of Circumciſion, or was under any neceſſity of having it ſeal'd to him by the ſign of it. I conclude therefore, that how true ſoever it may be, that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Sacrament is a ſeal of the New Covenant; Yet the Text be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mention'd conferrs not at all to the proving of it, and much leſs toward the ſhewing, that it hath no other relation than that of a <hi>ſeal</hi> either to that Covenant, or the graces of it. But beſide that the ſingle notion of a ſeal, how plauſible ſoever it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, hath no countenance from that Text, which is uſually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced for it; It will be found to have as little from the nature of that Covenant, of which it is repreſented as a ſeal. For that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant importing as well the conferring of preſent benefits, as a promiſe of future ones, it muſt conſequently if it be tranfacted by any viſible ceremony, make uſe of that ceremony to convey thoſe preſent benefits, as well as to aſcertain the exhibition of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ones; The former whereof a ſeal being no way proper for, or at leaſt not in the uſual notion of it, we are in reaſon to give the reſpective Sacraments of that Covenant another, and a more effectual notion, even that of a <hi>means,</hi> whereby Chriſt, who is the Author of them, conveys his graces to mankind.</p>
                     <p>One only relation there is beſides, which a Sacrament bears to the Divine Grace, even that of a <hi>pledge to aſſure us thereof</hi> (as our <hi>Catechiſm</hi> expreſſeth it) or (as the <hi>25th Article</hi> of our Church hath it) a <hi>certain ſure witneſs of it.</hi> A relation, which ſtands ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently confirm'd by the <hi>imperceptibleneſs</hi> of the Divine <hi>Grace</hi> in it ſelf, and the <hi>aptneſs of a Sacrament</hi> to manifeſt its approaches to us. For as the imperceptibleneſs of the Divine Grace in it ſelf makes it but neceſſary; for the comfort of mankind, to have its approaches manifeſted to them by ſome other ways, and means; ſo a Sacrament as before deſcrib'd, is an apt means to notifie it to us, yea aſſure us of the approaches of it. Partly, becauſe a means to which God hath annexed the exhibition of his grace, and partly becauſe ſuch a means, as is apparent to mens ſenſes, and which therefore whilſt they are ſo aſſured of, they can as little doubt of that Grace, which by the Decree of God is annexed to it.</p>
                     <p>Of the relation a Sacrament bears to the <hi>Divine Grace</hi> I have ſpoken hitherto, and ſhewn what <hi>kind,</hi> or kinds of relation it beareth to it; I come now, according to the method before laid down, to entreat of its relation to <hi>our ſelves,</hi> and of that <hi>piety,</hi> and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56517:16"/>
                        <hi>ſervice,</hi> which we owe to the giver of it. For the underſtanding whereof we are to know, that as a Sacrament is undoubtedly a ſign of that, of which it is ſuch, ſo if it hath a relation to our piety (as I have before ſhewn it to have, and as the very <hi>title</hi> of a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> in the <hi>Original</hi> notion of it, obligeth us to conceive) it muſt be look'd upon as ſuch a ſign, whereby we may make a <hi>declaration of that piety of ours,</hi> as was before obſerv'd out of Mr. <hi>Calvin.</hi> But ſo we do in Baptiſm, as by other ways, and means, ſo eſpecially by our receipt of it, as a mark of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent acknowledgment of thoſe Divine Perſons, into whoſe names we are baptized, and a reſolution for ever after to keep a good Conſcience to them: In the Euchariſt, by the grateful commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration we there make of the death of Chriſt, <hi>by</hi> a declaration of our intimate union with thoſe, who partake with us thereof, and a reſolvedneſs to maintain it by all the offices of love, and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Which things I do now only mention, becauſe I muſt inſiſt upon them more largely elſewhere, and whither it will be more proper to deferr the particular explication of them. Only as a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> appears to have receiv'd its <hi>Name</hi> from the obligation it layes upon us to the performance of religious duties; ſo I cannot forbear to add, that as it is a declaration of that piety we owe to God, ſo it is alſo an obligation to the continuance of it: Becauſe (as I ſhall afterwards ſhew) it ſerves to conciliate, or renew that <hi>New Covenant,</hi> by which we are obliged to them.</p>
                     <p>From that <hi>ſecond</hi> thing, to which a Sacrament relates, paſs we to the <hi>third,</hi> even that <hi>New Covenant,</hi> in which both the former are founded, and to which I ſhall not ſtick to affirm: <hi>Firſt,</hi> that a Sacrament hath the relation of a <hi>ſign,</hi> becauſe at once repreſenting the concernments of each party, what God obligeth himſelf to conferr, and what we make profeſſion of performing. But neither ſhall I ſtick to affirm, that it hath <hi>moreover</hi> the relation of <hi>ſuch</hi> a ſign, whereby the parties concern'd declare their <hi>conſent</hi> to it, and ſo make that, which was before but in a diſpoſition, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>Covenant,</hi> or, at moſt, but in a weak, and tottering condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to become actually, and firmly ſuch. Which if any man ſhall give the title of a <hi>Seal</hi> unto, I for my part ſhall not be at all diſpleas'd, becauſe <hi>ſeals</hi> were ſometime<note n="(b)" place="margin">Neh. 9.38.</note> made uſe of, for the declaration of ſuch a conſent. But I have my ſelf avoided to make uſe of the expreſſion, becauſe there may be ſome Ambiguity in it; And becauſe they, who have lately employ'd it, ſeem to look upon it as a thing, which rather adds ſtrength to mens faith concerning it, than to the Covenant it ſelf, and much leſs doth either give be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, or renew it. Whereas <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> in my opinion, is that, which firſt ſtrikes the Covenant between God, and man, and the Euchariſt, that which continues, or renews it after it hath been ſhatter'd by our miſcarriages; As is evident; as to the <hi>former,</hi> by its being the means of<note n="(c)" place="margin">Matt. 28.19.</note>

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56517:16"/>to be better enlightned in it. For which cauſe I ſhall only add, that as the conſent, we now ſpeak of, is in a Sacrament declar'd by both parties; ſo he, who adminiſters it, is in that caſe in the place of God, and declares his conſent to the Covenant; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe doing what he doth by vertue of that Commiſſion<note n="(g)" place="margin">Matt. 28.19.</note>, which empower'd the Apoſtles, and their Succeſſors to <hi>Baptize</hi> all, that ſhould offer themſelves unto it, and made them the <hi>diſpenſers</hi> of that, and the other<note n="(h)" place="margin">1 Cor. 4.1.</note> 
                        <hi>myſteries</hi> of our Religion.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> and <hi>laſt thing,</hi> to which I affirm'd a Sacrament to relate, is the <hi>body of Chriſt,</hi> even that <hi>myſtical</hi> one, which is made up by thoſe, that believe in him, and adore him. Now to this <hi>Body</hi> it relates, in the <hi>general,</hi> as a <hi>diſcriminative ſign</hi> of the profeſſion of it, and by which the ſeveral members thereof may both know, and be known by one another, and accordingly joyn in ſuch <hi>acts,</hi> as God exacts of their body. For becauſe God, who made men ſociable Creatures, was willing they ſhould wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him in ſociety alſo, as for other reaſons, ſo to make him an apt return<note n="(i)" place="margin">Expl. of the fourth Com.

                        </note> ſpeaks) <hi>men cannot be aſſociated into any Religious body,</hi> nor indeed into any other, <hi>but by a community of viſible ſigns, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments</hi> (of which, beſide the thus confederating of men of all Religions, we have a proof in men's general inability to judge of the profeſſion of their Aſſociates by any other way, than by ſuch outward notes, or characters) therefore, I ſay, God, and Chriſt, when they meant to erect a Chriſtian body, gave it ſuch ſigns, and notes alſo; Partly, to give beginning to it, and the ſeveral mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it, and partly to continue them in thoſe joynt Offices, and ſervices, which they requir'd the performance of. The former whereof is done by the Sacrament of Baptiſm, the latter by the Sacrament of the Euchariſt. And how much theſe two Sacraments conferr toward the keeping up the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, will appear, on the one hand, from thoſe miſerable <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who live under the <hi>Turks,</hi> and, on the other, from thoſe much more miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perſons the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who live among our ſelves. For as the poor <hi>Greeks,</hi> by reaſon of the <hi>ignorance of their Prieſts,</hi> and the <hi>unintelligibleneſs,</hi> as well as the <hi>hudling up</hi> of their <hi>Liturgies,</hi> have little other means beſide thoſe Sacraments, and other ſuch ſymbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical rites to keep up the profeſſion of Chriſtianity among them (which yet, it may be, they are more tenacious of, than thoſe who are better inſtructed among us, would be under the like circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances) ſo thoſe much more miſerable perſons the <hi>Quakers,</hi> having thrown off the viſible ſigns of Chriſtianity, have upon the matter come to throw off Chriſtianity it ſelf, and whatſoever it obligeth us either to believe, or do in order to our obtaining the ſalvation promiſed by it. If they have made a ſhift to rear, or keep up ſo much as their own <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> it was owing in the beginning to that <hi>Quaking,</hi> which gave denomination to them, and, ſince that, to their <hi>affected looks,</hi> and <hi>habits,</hi> and behaviour, which are, if I may ſo ſpeak, the <hi>viſible ſigns,</hi> or <hi>Sacraments</hi> thereof. And, if once they fall off from theſe, as we ſee they begin to do, we ſhall ſoon find their profeſſion to fail together with it, and to be buried in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56517:17"/>the ſame grave. But to return to that more <hi>ſacred body,</hi> of which I but now entreated, and to which as I affirm'd a Sacrament to have the relation of a general badge, or diſcriminative ſign of the profeſſion of it, ſo I muſt alſo to be a <hi>means</hi> of <hi>bringing particular men into it,</hi> or <hi>continuing them in the communion of it:</hi> It being <hi>into this body</hi> (as was before obſerv'd out of St. <hi>Paul</hi>) that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are <hi>baptiz'd,</hi> and ſo therefore firſt entred by that Sacrament; And in that body too that they continue by the receipt of the other Sacrament, becauſe it is, by their <hi>partaking of the bread</hi> of it, that the ſame St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms, that they become that <hi>one Bread,</hi> and <hi>Body.</hi> For being members of that body by the former Sacrament, they cannot otherwiſe be ſaid to make it up by the partaking of the latter, than as that may ſerve to keep them within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of it.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. An account being thus given of the <hi>things,</hi> to which a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament relates, together with the <hi>nature of that relation</hi> it bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to them; It remains that I enquire what the <hi>foundation</hi> of that relation is, which is the only thing farther to be known toward the diſcovery of the properties of a Sacrament. For the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding whereof we are to know, that as the relation, whereof we ſpeak, is of different ſorts, to wit the relation of a <hi>ſign,</hi> of a <hi>means of conveyance,</hi> and of a <hi>pledge</hi> (for ſuch I have ſhewn a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to be, as to that grace of God, to which it principally referrs) ſo it may have different foundations, agreeably to that diverſity, which I have ſaid to be in the nature of the relation. For, as a <hi>ſign,</hi> it is founded in part in the <hi>reſemblance,</hi> which it bears to the things ſignified by it (for ſo all ſigns of <hi>repreſentation</hi> are) and in part alſo in the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of him, whoſe the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is: Becauſe as the former reſemblance is not ſo apparent, as by its own force to have ſuggeſted to us the things ſignified by it, ſo it could not without his inſtitution, whoſe the Sacrament is, have laid any obligation upon us to conſider it in that relation of it. I ſay not the ſame concerning that relation of a Sacrament, whereby it becomes a <hi>means of conveying</hi> to us the Divine grace, or <hi>a pledge to aſſure us thereof:</hi> Becauſe each of theſe relations is founded <hi>ſimply,</hi> and <hi>only</hi> in the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of him, whoſe the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is. For a Sacrament having no natural aptitude either to convey the Divine Grace to us, or to aſſure us, that if we receive that Sacrament, we ſhall receive the other alſo; It muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently (if it become ſuch a <hi>means,</hi> or <hi>pledge</hi>) become ſo by the Inſtitution of him, by whom it is ſuggeſted to us. But becauſe I have ſaid nothing hitherto, <hi>whoſe</hi> that <hi>Inſtitution</hi> is, by vertue of which a Sacrament puts on the forementioned relations; And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is alike certain, that whoſoever's that Inſtitution is, yet it produceth not thoſe effects by its own immediate force, but by the intervention of ſome Act, or Acts of thoſe, whom he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the diſpenſation of them; Therefore, to ſatisfie our ſelves yet farther concerning the <hi>foundation</hi> of thoſe relations, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire we in the next place <hi>whoſe</hi> that Inſtitution is, upon which they are founded, and <hi>how</hi> that Inſtitution ought to be <hi>appli'd</hi> to enable it to produce them.</p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:56517:17"/>
                     <p>As concerning the <hi>Perſon,</hi> whoſethat Inſtitution is, little needs to be ſaid, conſidering what the Scripture hath ſaid concerning Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, and the Lord's Supper, which are the only clear Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our Religion. For Baptiſm, and the Lord's Supper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apparently <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s own Inſtitutions, and ſo declared to be by thoſe Scriptures, which give an account of them; Whatſoever hath the relation of a Sacrament, muſt have him for its <hi>Author,</hi> or (as our Church hath expreſſed it) be <hi>ordained</hi> by him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, a Sacrament, as ſuch, being both a conveyer, and a pledge of <hi>Grace,</hi> the diſpenſation whereof is entruſted unto Chriſt<note n="(l)" place="margin">Eph. 4, 7. —15, 16.</note>, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that, which pretends to be a Sacrament, muſt have him for its Author, or it muſt not be look'd upon under that relation. And thus far we find even thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> to go, becauſe not only repreſenting <hi>all the Sacraments of the New Law</hi> as <hi>inſtituted by Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our Lord, but pronouncing an Anathema alſo<note n="(m)" place="margin">Conc. Trid. Seſſ. 7. Can. 1. de Sacr.</note> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe, that ſhall deny it.</p>
                     <p>It being therefore not at all to be doubted, <hi>whoſe</hi> that <hi>Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is, upon which the relations of a Sacrament are founded; enquire we in the next place <hi>how</hi> that inſtitution ought to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli'd, to enable it to produce thoſe relations. Which muſt be firſt by a declaration of the purport thereof, and ſecondly by doing thoſe things to the elements, which either the <hi>general tenour of the Chriſtian Religion,</hi> or the <hi>particular precepts of the Inſtitution</hi> prompt us to the <hi>performance</hi> of. That I repreſent the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe as one of thoſe things, which makes the Inſtitution of Chriſt to become effectual toward the producing of the former relations, or (as it is more commonly expreſſed) toward the conſecration of thoſe elements, which are to put them on, is partly upon the account of the neceſſity of ſuch a declaration, and partly upon the account of the Commands of him, by whom the Sacraments were inſtituted. For a Sacrament being not ſo clear a repreſentation of <hi>that,</hi> of which it is ſo, as by its own force to ſuggeſt it to the minds of thoſe, for whom it was intended; Being much leſs ſo clear a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of it, as to invite thoſe to reflect upon it, who are either ſlow of underſtanding, or otherwiſe indiſpoſed to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate it, ſuch as are the generality of men; It cannot but be thought neceſſary, even upon that account, to call in the aſſiſtance of ſuch words, as may declare to thoſe, that are concern'd, for what ends, and purpoſes it was appointed. Otherwiſe men may either look upon the whole as a purely civil action, or (if the Perſon that adminiſters it, and other ſuch like circumſtances prompt them to conceive of it, as a religious one) yet fancy to themſelves ſuch ends, and purpoſes, as are either different from, or contrary to the true intendment of it. Agreeable hereto is the command of the Author of our reſpective Sacraments, as is evident from what he enjoyns concerning Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper; His own expreſs injunction concerning the former being, that his Diſciples ſhould baptize men <hi>in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which could not be done without a <hi>rehearſal</hi> of thoſe <hi>names</hi> at leaſt; As concerning the latter, that they ſhould do what they had ſeen, and heard him do, as oft as that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was adminiſtred, and therefore alſo make a verbal declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56517:18"/>concerning it. For though that be not ſo clear from thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> I mean as they lie in St. <hi>Luke</hi>
                        <note n="(n)" place="margin">Luk. 22.19.</note>; yet will it be found to be ſo, if we take in the Comment of St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <note n="(o)" place="margin">1 Cor. 11, 20. &amp;c.</note>, where he gives a like account of the Inſtitution of it. For repreſenting what was then ſaid, and done as a preſcription for future<note n="(p)" place="margin">1 Cor. 23.25, 26.</note> Sacraments, as well as for that of Chriſt's <hi>own immediate conſecration;</hi> Repreſenting it moreover as ſuch upon the account of what Chriſt then enjoyn'd concerning their doing the ſame things in remembrance of him, he muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently (becauſe he brings in our Saviour making a <hi>verbal</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration concerning the purport of that Sacrament, and ſubjoyns the former injunction to it) be thought to repreſent it as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's mind, that they, who conſecrated that Sacrament, ſhould uſe the ſame declarations concerning it. But beſide a <hi>declaration of the purport of the Inſtitution,</hi> and which the Church hath gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally kept ſo cloſe to, as to make that declaration by the very <hi>words</hi>
                        <note n="(q)" place="margin">Conſtit. Apoſt. li. 8. c. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>of the Inſtitution,</hi> it is no doubt alike neceſſary, if not more toward the producing of the former relations, to do thoſe things to the Elements, which either the general tenour of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, or the particular precepts of the Inſtitution prompt us to the performance of. For if Prayer be ſo generally neceſſary to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the procuring of any favour, that it becomes ſuch as to the obtaining of common, and ordinary ones; If it be ſo far neceſſary toward them, as to become ſuch even to the bleſſing of our ordinary repaſt<note n="(r)" place="margin">1. Tim. 4.4.5.</note>, though that be not without a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral aptitude to nouriſh, and ſuſtain us; How much more may we think it to be neceſſary, as to the making of thoſe elements, which are in no diſpoſition to it, to become the conveyers of the Divine Grace to thoſe, who are to partake of them. But ſo the perpetual practice of the Church will oblige us to believe, and act, as to the one, and other Sacrament, of our Religion. For though there be not any particular injunction concerning conſecrating the water of Baptiſm, and I ſuppoſe becauſe the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity thereof was ſufficiently known by what the Scripture hath ſaid concerning the general neceſſity thereof; Yet as we find <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> admoniſhing St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <note n="(ſ)" place="margin">Act. 22.16.</note> 
                        <hi>to waſh away his ſins</hi> by Baptiſm <hi>calling upon the name of the Lord,</hi> and which, no doubt, becauſe he Baptiz'd him, the ſame <hi>Ananias</hi> went before him in; As we find farther by <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi>
                        <note n="(t)" place="margin">Apolog. 2.</note>, that they, who were to be baptiz'd, were admoniſhed to <hi>faſt, and pray, the Brethren praying, and faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for, and with them</hi> (for theſe are ſufficient proofs, that ſome ſort of <hi>Prayers</hi> did alway precede it) ſo we find by thoſe, who have given a more particular account of the Offices of the Church, that the Prieſt did pray particularly<note n="(u)" place="margin">Conſtit. Apoſt. lib. 7. c. 43. Dionyſ. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reop. Eccl. Hier. c. 2.</note>, that <hi>God would look down from Heaven, and ſanctifie that water, wherein they were to be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by him.</hi> The caſe is yet more plain as to the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, as ſhall be made appear, when I come to entreat purpoſely concerning it. And therefore I ſhall only add, that as the Inſtitution of our reſpective Sacraments cannot obtain its effect, without doing thoſe things to the Elements thereof, which the general tenour of Chriſtianity obligeth us to perform, ſo much leſs without the doing of thoſe things, which <hi>the particular</hi> precepts of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56517:18"/>the Inſtitution oblige to the practice of. For the force of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment depending more immediately upon the Inſtitution of him, whoſe the Sacrament is, it muſt conſequently, as to the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Inſtitution, depend more upon the doing of thoſe things, which the particular precepts of the Inſtitution oblige to the practice of, than upon thoſe, which the more general, and therefore remoter precepts of Chriſtianity oblige unto. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence whereof, as to the Euchariſt, will be, among other things, a neceſſity of giving God thanks for thoſe gracious boons, which that Sacrament was intended both to convey, and aſſure. The reſult of the premiſes is this; A Sacrament, as ſuch, is a relative thing, it is ſo in an eſpecial manner as to the Divine Grace, as which it ſignifies, and conveyes, and aſſures. But as thoſe rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof are <hi>founded,</hi> rather in the inſtitution of the Author of it, than in the vertue of thoſe elements, in which they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; ſo in <hi>that</hi> again, not ſo much as delivered by our Saviour, as applied to the elements by a declaration of the purport of it, and by ſuch other Acts as the general tenour of Chriſtianity, or the particular precepts of the Inſtitution oblige thoſe, who are the diſpenſers of a Sacrament, to do to the elements thereof.</p>
                     <p>I do not at all found the relations of a Sacrament in ſuch Act, or Acts, as are requir'd of thoſe, that partake of it; Yea though without ſuch Act, or Acts, they cannot partake of the Graces of it: Partly, becauſe a Sacrament being an inſtitution of Chriſt, it muſt rather depend upon his appointment, and the facts of thoſe, who act in his behalf, than upon the diſpoſition of ſuch as are to partake of it; And partly, becauſe a Sacrament, though not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying, or aſſuring the Divine Grace to any, but the worthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers of it, yet is as really and truly a Sacrament to thoſe, who are otherwiſe diſpos'd, as it is to the moſt worthy ones. As is evident among other things from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s affirming the unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receiver of the Euchariſt to be <hi>guilty of the Body</hi>
                        <note n="(w)" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.27.</note>, <hi>and Blood of Chriſt,</hi> and again to <hi>eat, and drink Damnation to himſelf, for not diſcerning</hi>
                        <note n="(x)" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.29.</note> 
                        <hi>the Lord's Body.</hi> For how come they to be <hi>guilty of the Body, and Blood of Chriſt</hi> by the meer reception of the elements, if thoſe elements be not even to them a <hi>Sacrament</hi> of his Body, and Blood? Or how faulty for not <hi>diſcerning</hi> in them the Lord's Body, and Blood, if thoſe elements, which they receive, have not the relation of a <hi>Sacrament</hi> to them? Neither will it avail to ſay, that ſuch perſons may become <hi>guilty</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Body, and Blood,</hi> becauſe receiving not as they ought, thoſe elements, which are the <hi>ſigns</hi> of them. For as it will follow from thence, that thoſe elements, which they receive, are ſo far, at leaſt, a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt's Body, and Blood, I mean as that is a ſign of them; ſo there is reaſon enough to believe from the way the Apoſtle takes to prove the foremention'd charge, that thoſe ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were as really a Sacrament to them in all other reſpects, as they were in the notion of a <hi>ſign:</hi> Becauſe he founds that charge of his upon Chriſt's making thoſe elements the Sacrament of his Body, and Blood<note n="(y)" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.27.</note>, and which therefore he muſt ſuppoſe them to be as much to them, as they are to any perſon whatſoever. That which I conceive hath occaſion'd men to be otherwiſe opinionated,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56517:19"/>was their conceiving of a Sacrament, not as a means <hi>fitted by Chriſt</hi> to convey, or aſſure the Divine Grace, and which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, where it is duly receiv'd, actually doth ſo; but as a thing, which is not only in a diſpoſition to it, but, where it is really a Sacrament, <hi>infallibly</hi> doth ſo to all, that partake of it. Which conceit, it may be, they were the more eaſily betray'd into by the Scriptures repreſenting it rather as a thing, which actually <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifies,</hi> and <hi>ſaves,</hi> than as a thing, which is only fitted for it. But as there might be ground enough for ſuch <hi>expreſſions,</hi> as thoſe, whether upon the account of the perſons, whom it is ſo ſaid to <hi>ſanctifie, and ſave,</hi> or upon the account of there being enough in a Sacrament to do it, where the parties, that partake of it, are duly qualified for it; ſo the Scripture hath ſometimes ſo qualified its own aſſertions by making the due diſpoſition of the party recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it to be neceſſary to procure the other, that we cannot but look upon a Sacrament, rather as a thing fitted to produce ſuch effects, than as actually, and infallibly producing them. And indeed, as there is therefore but reaſon to conceive ſo of a Sacrament, even as a means fitted by God, and Chriſt to produce thoſe effects, which are attributed to it; ſo, by thus ſtating it, a way is opened to diſtinguiſh between the <hi>Efficacy of a Sacrament,</hi> and of the <hi>Receiver's faith,</hi> and accordingly to aſſign each its proper intereſt in the procuring of thoſe Graces, which are attributed to it. For by this means we ſhall make a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> with that bleſſing of God, which attends it, to be the ſole conferrer, and aſſurer of thoſe Graces, which is but agreeable to it as an <hi>inſtrument in the hand of God;</hi> And the <hi>faith</hi> of the party receiving only the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, and applier of the other, which is as agreeable to that <hi>hand</hi> of man. For as, if a Sacrament be a means fitted by God for the forementioned purpoſes, the conferring, and aſſuring of thoſe Graces will belong to it, and that bleſſing of God, which doth accompany it; ſo nothing therefore will remain to the faith of the party receiving, but to receive, and apply what the other doth ſo conferr, and aſſure. I ſay, ſecondly, that as by this means a due diſtinction will be made between the <hi>efficacy</hi> of a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> of the receiver's <hi>faith;</hi> ſo a way will be opened in like manner (without detracting, in the leaſt, from the <hi>efficacy</hi> of a <hi>Sacrament</hi>) to return an anſwer to what is advanc'd, on the one hand, for the <hi>opus operatum</hi> of all Sacraments, and, on the other, for making the <hi>elements</hi> of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> to be <hi>that very Body,</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Chriſt, which it was intended to convey. For whereas it is pretended<note n="(z)" place="margin">Vid. Chem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit. Exam. Conc. Trid. Part. <hi>2.</hi> in Can. <hi>7, 8.</hi> de Sacram.</note>, in the behalf of the former, and accordingly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as a proof of it, that the efficacy of a Sacrament depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the inſtitution of God, and not upon the dignity of him, that adminiſters it, or the faith of the receiver; I anſwer, that that is indeed true, and agreeable enough to our ſtating the nature of a Sacrament, but of no force at all to ſhew that <hi>opus operatum,</hi> whereof they ſpeak. For as, if a Sacrament be a means fitted by Chriſt for the conferring of his Graces, the conferring of thoſe Graces will belong wholly to it, and that bleſſing of God, which goes along with it; ſo if it be a means rather fitted for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of them, than that, which actually, and infallibly doth,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56517:19"/>any otherwiſe than as it is receiv'd, and appli'd, as Chriſtianity admoniſheth, there will be a like neceſſity of the <hi>opus operantis,</hi> even of that faith, and repentance, which are requir'd in order to the reception of them. And it may not unfitly be illuſtrated by the natural quality of thoſe elements, which are by Chriſt made uſe of for the Sacrament of his own Body, and Blood. For as of what force ſoever thoſe elements may be either to ſuſtain, or refreſh us, yet they cannot be expected to do either, unleſs they be receiv'd, and well digeſted; ſo how well fitted ſoever by the Inſtitution of God the ſame elements may be to conferr to higher purpoſes, yet there is as little reaſon to expect they ſhould, unleſs they be applied by us, as he, who ſo inſtituted them, hath admoniſh'd. In like manner, whereas it is pretended<note n="*" place="margin">Eſth. Com. in locum.</note> from unworthy receivers of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> being <hi>guilty of the Body and Blood of Chriſt,</hi> that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe elements, which they do ſo receive, are <hi>really</hi> that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and Blood, and accordingly are actually partook of; That alſo is taken away by what we have before ſaid concerning the Euchariſts being a means fitted by Chriſt for the conveying of them: Becauſe, if it be only ſuch, there will be place for that guilt, yea though that Body, and Blood of Chriſt be not in it, nor receiv'd by thoſe, who are partakers of the other; In as much as he offers a ſufficient affront to them, who receives thoſe elements unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, which were by God, and Chriſt intended, and fitted for the conveying of them. I may not omit to add, if it were only for that hint, which the former obſervation affords us, that we ſhall, by thus ſtating the nature of a Sacrament, imprint alſo in the minds of men a juſt apprehenſion of that guilt, which ariſeth from an unworthy reception of it For as, if it be fitted by Chriſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey, or aſſure the Divine Grace, it muſt make thoſe, that partake unworthily thereof, guilty of an equal affront to that Grace, which it is ſo fitted to convey, or aſſure; ſo if it be not ſo fitted, the crime will ſtill be the leſs, by how much the leſs relation it hath to that Grace, which is pretended to be violated by the unworthy reception of it. In fine, by ſtating the nature of a Sacrament, as is before deſcrib'd, we ſhall make our account thereof agree ſo much the more exactly with that, which our own Catechiſm pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents us withall; That, though it repreſent a Sacrament as a means of Grace, and a pledge of it, yet repreſenting it not as <hi>actually,</hi> and infallibly ſuch, but only as ordained by God to be ſo, and which accordingly, in the event, may prove ſuch, or not, as it ſhall be found to be receiv'd, and appli'd.</p>
                     <p>For the applying of all which to the buſineſs, that is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, even the making up of that <hi>Definition,</hi> which we have been hitherto making way to, I cannot but admoniſh, that a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment referring to ſo many ſeveral things, and referring to them alſo with ſo many different relations, it will be hard, or rather impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to furniſh out any one definition of it, which ſhall with any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs anſwer to its ſeveral properties. For conſidering a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with reſpect to the <hi>Divine Grace,</hi> and to which of all others it ſeems more eſpecially to relate; ſo it may, and ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to be ſuch an outward, and viſible ſign thereof, as is moreover ordained, and fitted by Chriſt to be a means of conveying it to us,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56517:20"/>and a pledge to aſſure us thereof. Conſidering it again, with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>our own piety,</hi> and to which no doubt it was alſo intended to adminiſter; ſo it will be ſuch an outward and viſible ſign there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as is by Chriſt ordained, and fitted for us to make a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it by, and an obligation to the continuance of it. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it Thirdly, with relation to that <hi>New Covenant,</hi> by which the Divine Grace, and our piety are ty'd together; ſo it will be ſuch an outward, and viſible ſign as is ordained, and fitted by the ſame Chriſt, for God, and Man to declare their conſent unto it by, and either firſt enter into that Covenant by it, or to renew it. Conſidering it laſtly, with reſpect to <hi>thoſe,</hi> who are joyn'd together in the ſame Covenant, and ſo connected to Chriſt, and to one another; ſo it will be ſuch an outward, and viſible ſign, as is by Chriſt ordained, and fitted for a general badge of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon profeſſion, and a means of bringing particular men into their Society, or continuing them in the Communion of it. Only if any man deſire a more ſimple definition of it, and which though it will not anſwer to all the properties thereof, yet will at leaſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the more eſpecial ones; ſo it may not inconveniently be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to be ſuch an outward, and viſible ſign, as is ordained and fitted by Chriſt to ſignifie, and convey, and aſſure the Divine Grace to us, and, on our part, to declare the duty we owe to God, and Chriſt, and oblige our ſelves to the continual practice of it.</p>

                     <p>In the general I obſerve, that as it appears by our own Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm, and the definition before given, that a Sacrament conſiſts of an outward, and viſible Sign, and an inward Spiritual Grace; ſo that more general notion of it ſtands confirm'd to us by the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage of <hi>Irenaeus</hi>
                        <note n="(a)" place="margin">Adv. haer. l. 4. c. 34.</note>, though by him delivered under another form: He repreſenting the Euchariſt, even after the Invocation of God hath paſt upon it, as conſiſting of two things, to wit, an <hi>Earthly,</hi> and a <hi>Heavenly</hi> one. And I ſhall only add, that they ſeem not to be over mindful of it, who make the Sign, or <hi>Earthly</hi> part of the Euchariſt to vaniſh, as ſoon as the thing ſignified by it, or the <hi>Heavenly</hi> one approacheth: A Sign in the common underſtanding of it, together with that <hi>relation</hi> whereby it becomes ſo, and thoſe accidents, wherein it is immediately founded, connoting the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> of them both, and therefore not with reaſon to be predicated of that Sacrament, which hath no ſuch <hi>Subject</hi> to uphold them.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe there is otherwiſe no great Controverſie concerning the general notion of a Sacrament, nor yet ſo far, concerning that particular one I before gave, as to its being an outward, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Sign of that, of which it is a Sacrament; Therefore paſs we both from the one, and the other, to that <hi>Heavenly</hi> thing, to which it relates, the <hi>manner</hi> of its relation to it, and the foundation of that relation.</p>
                     <p>Now as the firſt of theſe hath been before defin'd to be an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Grace,</hi> as that again declar'd to be ſuch a Grace, or favour of God, as conduceth in an eſpecial manner to the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of our inward Man, or Spirit; ſo I muſt now add, for the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Explication of it, that it is moreover ſuch a Grace, as conduceth <hi>immediately</hi> to the welfare of it: Whether as purifying the ſoul from the filth of ſin, and introducing the contrary affections, or as delivering it from that guilt, which the filth of ſin had brought upon it. A notion, which ſtands confirm'd to us, not only by the Doctrine of our own <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> but by the account the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> gives us both of Baptiſm and the Euchariſt, and the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves.

Which is the rather to be noted, becauſe of the uſe it will hereafter be of toward the determining the <hi>Number</hi> of thoſe things, which are to be accounted of as <hi>Sacraments</hi> of our Religion.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the <hi>relation</hi> a Sacrament bears to the object of it, and particularly to that Grace, to which it eſpecially referrs, I have nothing to add, and ſhall not therefore bring it again under conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. I ſhall only obſerve, from what hath been before ſaid concerning it, that it is an <hi>inſtrument</hi> of Grace, as well as a <hi>pledge</hi>
                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:56517:22"/>of it, that it is a <hi>moral</hi> inſtrument thereof, and not a <hi>phyſical</hi> one, that it is <hi>ſuch</hi> a moral inſtrument thereof, as is rather <hi>apt</hi> to convey, or produce it, than that which <hi>actually,</hi> and <hi>infallibly</hi> doth; The actual conveying of that Grace depending upon the due diſpoſition of the party receiving it, and who (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks) if he be not rightly qualified for it, will rather reap <hi>Damnation</hi> by it, than either the Divine Graces, or the rewards of them. Which things I have this ſecond time made mention of, not becauſe they were not before ſufficiently clear'd, but becauſe they lay diſperſedly in my former account of this <hi>relation,</hi> and ſo would have been leſs uſeful toward the forming a diſtinct conception of it.</p>
                     <p>That, which will eſpecially require our ſecond thoughts, is the <hi>foundation</hi> of that, and other the relations of a Sacrament; The which as I have affirm'd <hi>in the general</hi> to be the Inſtitution of Chriſt, ſo the farther conſideration of that Inſtitution will both lead us to a more diſtinct knowledge of the nature of a Sacrament, and inform us concerning the <hi>neceſſity,</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> thereof. Now as there are two things, which that Inſtitution doth manifeſtly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that is to ſay a <hi>Command,</hi> and a <hi>Promiſe;</hi> ſo that <hi>Command</hi> again reſpects the <hi>elements</hi> of a Sacrament, either as being <hi>to put on</hi> that relation, or as actually <hi>inveſted with it.</hi> In the former of theſe regards it commands the ſetting them apart for that purpoſe, but more eſpecially (becauſe that is the principal deſign of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament) for their becoming a means of conveying the Divine Graces to us. Which, as was before obſerv'd, it either preſcribes particular rules for, or remits men for them to the general pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Chriſtianity, ſo far as they are applicable thereto. And I ſhall only add (becauſe thoſe rules were before declar'd) that, to make the elements put on the relation of a Sacrament, there is a neceſſity of applying that part of the Inſtitution to them by the execution of thoſe Commands, which it enjoyns: Becauſe the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them apart for that purpoſe is, by the Inſtitution it ſelf, put into the hands of men. But of what men, and how qualified, I have not as yet declar'd, and ſhall therefore now ſet my ſelf to enquire.</p>
                     <p>And here in the firſt place it is eaſie to ſee, by what is deliver'd in the general concerning the <hi>power of remitting ſins,</hi> or in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular concerning the <hi>power of Baptiſm,</hi> that the Separation or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of the elements is the proper work of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, and ought accordingly to be left to them to perform: Becauſe as both the one, and the other were by Chriſt committed to his Apoſtles, ſo none can therefore pretend to the power of either, but thoſe who deriv'd it from them, which none but the Miniſters of the Goſpel have. It is no leſs eaſie to ſee ſecondly, that as the Separation, or Conſecration of the elements is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per work of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, even by the Inſtitution of Chriſt; ſo it cannot therefore, ordinarily at leaſt, be attempted without ſin by others, becauſe a deviation from his Inſtitution. And thus far all, who acknowledge a Miniſterial Function, are at an accord in this particular, and the farther proſecution thereof no way neceſſary to be intended. I ſay therefore thirdly, that as the Separation, or Conſecration of the elements cannot, ordinarily at
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56517:23"/>leaſt, be attempted without ſin by other than the Miniſters of the Goſpel; ſo there is reaſon enough to believe, even from thence, that thoſe elements cannot ordinarily have the relation of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by any others Conſecration, than theirs. For beſide that the Promiſe of Chriſt is not to be ſuppos'd to extend any farther, than thoſe Commands, to which it is annexed, are obſerv'd; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we think he will vouchſafe his benediction to that Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which without any neceſſity at all varies from his own Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: This being to encourage men to go againſt his own Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, which no wiſe Inſtitutor can be ſuppos'd to give way to. All therefore, that can be ſuppos'd to admit of a diſpute in this affair, is, whether in extraordinary Caſes (and where a lawful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter cannot be had) other Perſons may take upon them to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate, and Adminiſter it; And whether, if they do ſo, what they do is ſo far valid, as to make that, which they pretend to Conſecrate, and Adminiſter, to have the relation of a Sacrament. But as it would be conſider'd whether it were not equally advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable for ſuch Perſons to let alone altogether the Conſecration, and Adminiſtration thereof; Becauſe Chriſt may as well ſupply to men the want of the Sacraments themſelves, as the defects of thoſe, who pretend to Conſecrate, and Adminiſter them: As it would be conſidered farther, whether it were not much more adviſable to do ſo, becauſe he, who omits the Conſecration, or Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Sacrament, that belongs not properly to him, is certainly guilty of a far leſs error, than he who arrogates to himſelf that, which doth not appear to appertain unto him; ſo if a Sacrament ſo Conſecrated, or Adminiſtred, be either lawful, or valid (as I will not be very forward to deny it, conſidering the Authorities<note n="(h)" place="margin">Vid. Tert. de Bapt. c. 7. &amp; quae anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavit Hooke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus noſter Eccl. Pol. l. 5. Sect. 62.</note> it hath for it) it muſt become ſo by the either expreſs, or tacit allowance of thoſe, to whom the Adminiſtration of it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly committed. For the Inſtitutor of a Sacrament, and by whom alone it can become ſuch, having put into their hands the preparation of it, I ſee not how any thing can become ſuch, which is not either mediately, or immediately ſet apart by their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and Miniſtry.</p>
                     <p>It appearing from the Premiſes, to whom the ſeparation, or Conſecration of the elements doth belong, and ſo far therefore alſo the producing of a ſacramental relation in them; Enquire we in the next place how thoſe perſons ought to be farther qualified, to enable them to make that Separation, or Conſecration; Which I ſhall not ſtick to affirm to be ſimply, and only by keeping, as to the outward work, to the Inſtitution of our Saviour. For though much more may be requir'd of them, yea undoubtedly is, to make that Act of theirs available to their own welfare, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance; Even the intending what they are about, not only with a preſent mind, but with a ſound, and religious one; Yet cannot the like be ſuppoſed to be requir'd, to make that Act of theirs available toward the Conſecrating of thoſe elements into a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Partly becauſe if ſuch an intention were requir'd in thoſe, that Conſecrate, no man could have any tolerable aſſurance of his receiving a valid Sacrament, becauſe having no ſuch aſſurance of their intention; And partly, becauſe that Act of theirs is a <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56517:23"/>Act,</hi> and muſt not therefore depend for its force, upon the <hi>perſonal</hi> intentions or qualifications of thoſe, that exerciſe it, but upon that <hi>Authority,</hi> from which it proceeds, and upon its ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>ends,</hi> and <hi>intentions</hi> of thoſe principal Agents, to which it is appointed to miniſter. Which ends, and intentions if it can ſerve in this affair by an outward conformity to the rules of Chriſt's Inſtitution, nothing more can be ſuppos'd to be requir'd either of it, or thoſe, that exerciſe it, to give it that force, whereof we ſpeak. That therefore would in the next place be enquir'd into, which accordingly I will now ſet my ſelf to do.</p>

                        <note n="(k)" place="margin">1 Cor. 4.1.</note>, and <hi>graces</hi> to the Church, and, on the other hand, to offer up the <hi>Churches Prayers,</hi> and <hi>Services</hi> to them. From whence as it will follow, that thoſe <hi>principal</hi> Agents, to which they miniſter, are <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> on the one hand, and Chriſts <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>People</hi> under the other; ſo that the end of the <hi>former</hi> is to convey, by their means, their own graces, and bleſſings, of the <hi>latter</hi> to offer up thoſe Prayers, and other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, which are due from the Church to them. Thoſe therefore being the <hi>Principal</hi> Agents, to which the Evangelical Prieſthood miniſters, and thoſe their reſpective ends, and intentions; the next thing to be enquir'd into is, which of thoſe <hi>Principal</hi> Agents it is, to which the Evangelical Prieſthood miniſters in thoſe acts which reſpect the Conſecration of a Sacrament. Which I ſhall not ſtick to affirm, from what was before ſaid concerning thoſe Acts, to be the Church, and People of God. For that, which the Miniſter doth toward the Conſecration of a Sacrament, being principally, at leaſt, the offering up of Prayers and Praiſes, he muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently (becauſe thoſe are the duties of the Church to God, and Chriſt) be thought to miniſter to the <hi>Church</hi> in them, and ſo have that for his <hi>Principal</hi> Agent. From whence as it will follow thirdly, that the end to which he is to ſerve, is the offering up, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Church, ſuch Prayers, and Praiſes, as are by the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Chriſt impos'd upon it (becauſe that is the end of the Church in all ſuch Adminiſtrations); ſo he ſhall ſufficiently ſerve that end, who ſhall only rehearſe ſuch Prayers and Praiſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, or whatſoever his intention be: Becauſe the Church may as well offer up its Prayers, and Praiſes by the voice of him, that intends them not, as by the voice of him, that doth. And I have been the more particular in the Explication of this affair, partly to make it farther evident, that the validity of a Sacrament depends not upon the intention of the Miniſter, but much more to ſhew from thence, that thoſe acts, which are done by him toward the Conſecration of the Sacramental elements, do not, by the either
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56517:24"/>abſence, or perverſeneſs of his intention, ceaſe to be religious, and ſo incapable of inducing God to conſider of them, or give force unto them: Becauſe as thoſe Acts are rather the Churches, than his (the Miniſter being in this affair but the Inſtrument thereof) ſo his want of Intention, and Devotion, may be abundantly ſupply'd by the others, and thoſe Acts thereby become both Religious and valid.</p>
                     <p>From that Command, which reſpects the elements, before they put on the relation of a Sacrament, paſs we on to that Command, which conſiders them as inveſted with it; Which again we ſhall find to have a double reference. For it may either concern <hi>thoſe,</hi> in <hi>ſpecial,</hi> who have ſo ſet apart, or Conſecrated them, or both <hi>them</hi> (if they are alſo to be the receivers of them) and <hi>all others,</hi> for whoſe ſanctification they are intended. Upon the <hi>former</hi> of theſe it enjoyns the diſpenſing, or beſtowing of what they have ſo Conſecrated, as that too in ſuch a manner, and with ſuch ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, as the Inſtitutor thereof hath preſcrib'd. It enjoyns upon them farther, for their own ſouls health, to diſpenſe them with a ſutable intention, and devotion of ſoul; As without which what they do cannot otherwiſe be profitable to themſelves. But it doth not ſo injoyn that intention, and devotion, that what they diſpenſe, ſhall, for the want thereof, be in like manner unprofitable to others: Becauſe, as we already ſuppoſe the elements to have put on the relation of a Sacrament, and ſo far therefore to be in a capacity to profit thoſe, to whom they are diſpens'd; ſo it is Chriſt, and not the Miniſter, who muſt diſpenſe the Graces of the Sacrament, and the effect of that Sacrament therefore depend, not upon the Miniſter's intention, and purpoſe, but upon the intention, and purpoſe of Chriſt, whoſe Inſtrument, and Miniſter he is. As will appear yet more clearly, when I come to conſider the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> of the Inſtitution, the ſecond thing, whereof I affirmed it to conſiſt. Only, as that Command of it, which I am now entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, doth as well reſpect thoſe, for whoſe ſanctification the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments were intended, as thoſe who are the Conſecraters, and Diſpenſers of them; ſo I muſt therefore admoniſh firſt of all, that as that part of the Inſtitution of Chriſt enjoyns upon his Miniſters the diſpenſation of the Sacraments, ſo it muſt conſequently enjoyn the receipt, or uſe of them by all that are capable thereof, as without which the former injunction would be vain. I ſay, ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that as it enjoyns upon all, that are capable thereof, the receipt, or uſe of the Sacraments; ſo it enjoyns their receipt, or uſe of them under the relation of Sacraments, and particularly (becauſe that is the principal relation of a Sacrament) as a means appointed by Chriſt for the conveying of the Divine Graces. Which is ſo true as to thoſe Sacraments, which are the only clear, and undoubted ones, and by which, if there be any ſuch, the other are to be judg'd, that men are expreſly call'd upon to be <hi>Baptiz'd</hi>
                        <note n="(k)" place="margin">Act. 2.38.</note> 
                        <hi>for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> and as expreſly admoniſh'd by our Saviour to take the elements of the Euchariſt<note n="(l)" place="margin">Matt. 26.26, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Luk. 22.19.</note>, as that <hi>Body which was given for them,</hi> and as that <hi>Blood, which was ſhed for them, and others, for the</hi> ſame remiſſion of ſins. From whence as it will follow, that thoſe Sacraments are of <hi>neceſſary uſe,</hi> as which both the <hi>one,</hi> and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56517:24"/>the <hi>other injunction</hi> oblige us to believe; ſo they are alſo <hi>ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi> by vertue of the former, that <hi>they cannot be neglected</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin, and by the latter, if not the former, that men <hi>cannot hope for the graces of them,</hi> where thoſe Sacraments are in like manner <hi>neglected.</hi> For beſide that every neglect of a Command is, as ſuch, a ſin againſt the impoſer of it, and muſt conſequently not only deſpoil us of his favour, but expoſe us alſo to his Wrath, and Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance; Beſide that that neglect muſt be yet more ſinful, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, which is a neglect of ſuch a Command, as is enjoyn'd for the Subjects profit; He, who commands this, or that particular for ſuch, or ſuch an end, muſt thereby be preſum'd to declare, that he will not give it in any other way, than that, which is preſcribed by him: Becauſe otherwiſe a gap would be open to the Violation of his Authority, which every wiſe Lawgiver muſt be ſuppos'd to provide againſt. Neither will it avail to ſay, that there are other <hi>means,</hi> beſide Sacraments, for the attaining of the Divine Graces, and ſuch as God hath promis'd to reward with the beſtowing of them; Of which nature are our attendance to the <hi>word,</hi> and Prayer. For as it doth not appear, that theſe are any where repreſented as ſufficient of themſelves for that purpoſe, and therefore the Divine Graces not to be expected by them alone; ſo they can however be no farther repreſented as ſuch, than as made uſe of by men out of a due regard to his Authority, and wiſdom, by whom they are impoſed on them: Which cannot be ſuppos'd to be there, where any one preſcribed mean is neglected, becauſe the ſame Authority, and Wiſdom will lead to the obſervation of it. As little will it avail to ſay, that the Divine Graces have been ſometime beſtow'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, and the Sacraments therefore not to be accounted as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the attaining of them. For as the queſtion is not now, Whether Sacraments are ſo neceſſary, that the graces thereof can, in no caſe, be hop'd for without them, but whether they can be hoped for, where the Sacraments are neglected; ſo that they are <hi>ſo far</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary will need no other proof, than the enjoyning of Baptiſm to thoſe, who may ſeem, if any, to have attain'd the graces thereof without it. For ſo we find St. <hi>Peter</hi> to have done as to <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
                        <note n="(m)" place="margin">Act. 10.48.</note>, and his company; Yea though <hi>Cornelius</hi> had before his Preaching, receiv'd a Divine approbation of his <hi>Prayers,</hi> and <hi>Alms,</hi> and, after that, that <hi>gift of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> for the procuring whereof we find Baptiſm to have been eſpecially<note n="(n)" place="margin">Act. 2.38.</note> ordain'd. For well may we look upon that Sacrament as ſo far neceſſary to obtain the Divine Graces, the uſe whereof was commanded even to thoſe men, who had in a great meaſure before attain'd them. The only thing, that ſeems to me to admit of any doubt, is whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sacraments be ſo far neceſſary, that the Divine Graces cannot be had without them, or at leaſt cannot with any aſſurance be expected by us. But as the ſingle example of the Thief upon the Croſs (to ſay nothing now of that of <hi>Cornelius</hi>) may ſuffice to perſwade, that no Sacrament is ſo neceſſary, but that the Graces thereof may be had without it: As the benignity of the Divine nature, and thoſe Graces God hath ſometime given even to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized perſons, may ſerve in like manner to perſwade men, that if that, or any other Sacrament be wanting without their fault,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56517:25"/>it ſhall be otherwiſe ſupplied to them; So I cannot forbear to ſay, that ſuch perſons have not the ſame Aſſurance with that, which Baptized perſons have. Partly, becauſe they have no promiſe to bottom their aſſurance on, and partly, becauſe God, who may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex what conditions he pleaſeth to his own favours, hath made thoſe Sacraments, whereof we ſpeak, the ſtanding means of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them. I will conclude what I have to ſay concerning that part of the Inſtitution, which enjoyns the receipt, or uſe of the Sacraments, when I have admoniſhed in the third place, that it requires our coming to it with certain <hi>previous qualifications</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our receiving the benefit thereof. Which is ſo notorious as to Baptiſm, and the Lord's Supper, and will hereafter be ſo large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſiſted on, that I ſhall content my ſelf with the bare mention of it. All that I at preſent aim at, is to give a general account of what it enjoyns, and which having now in ſome meaſure done, I ſhall proceed to conſider of what it <hi>promiſeth,</hi> which is the <hi>ſecond</hi> thing whereof I affirmed the Inſtitution of a Sacrament to conſiſt.</p>
                     <p>For the clearing whereof we are <hi>firſt</hi> to know, that though thoſe <hi>Promiſes,</hi> whereof we ſpeak, are not always ſo expreſs, as its <hi>Commands</hi> muſt be acknowledg'd to have been; Yet will it not be difficult for us to evince the being of <hi>ſuch</hi> Promiſes, nor, after that, to ſhew <hi>what things</hi> it makes a promiſe of. For ſuppoſing, as we now may (becauſe I have heretofore evinced it) that the Inſtitution of Chriſt enjoyns the Adminiſtration, and uſe of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments for the bringing about thoſe gracious purpoſes, which they have no natural aptneſs to produce, and we muſt alſo ſuppoſe it to make a promiſe of Chriſt's making them effectual for thoſe purpoſes, for which they were ſo enjoyned by him. Becauſe otherwiſe thoſe Commands of his would give hope of ſuch things, as were not likely to accrue by the obſervation of them, and ſo (which is not to be ſuppos'd of the Commands of Chriſt) prove deluſory ones. Only as he, who inſtituted thoſe Sacraments for our benefit, cannot well be thought to omit any thing, which may encourage our expectation of it; ſo we find both him, and his Apoſtles ſometime to make expreſs promiſes of thoſe things, which the Sacraments were intended to convey. For thus after our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour had commanded the Adminiſtration of the Sacrament of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm to all, whom they could diſpoſe to the reception of it, the more to encourage them to intend the doing of it, he makes a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of being<note n="(o)" place="margin">Matt. 28.19, 20.</note> with them in it, and conſequently that their miniſtry, at leaſt, ſhould not fail of its intended effect in the Conſecration, and Adminiſtration of it. In like manner, after St. <hi>Peter</hi> had call'd upon thoſe to be Baptiz'd, whom God had ſtirred up by his precedent Preaching, to enquire after the means of Salvation; He doth not only inſinuate their obtaining remiſſion of ſins by it, by calling upon them to be Baptiz'd in order to it, but aſſure them alſo in expreſs terms<note n="(p)" place="margin">Act. 2.38.</note>, which he could not have done without a promiſe from Chriſt, that, if they were ſo Baptiz'd, they ſhould receive the <hi>gift of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It appearing from the Premiſes, that the Inſtitution of Chriſt is not without its promiſes, and ſuch too, as are ſometime deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd in expreſs terms; Enquire we in the next place what thoſe
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56517:25"/>promiſes are, or rather what things they make a promiſe of. Which, in the <hi>general,</hi> will be found to be, Chriſt's making what is done both by Miniſter, and People, in obedience to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, to be a vailable to thoſe ends, for which they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd. For neither otherwiſe could he have ſaid, that he would be with the <hi>former</hi> in thoſe Acts of theirs, and much leſs could St. <hi>Peter</hi> have aſſur'd to the latter the receiving of thoſe Graces, which Baptiſm was intended to convey. But from thence it will follow more particularly, that the Inſtitution of Chriſt makes a promiſe to the Miniſter, that he will convert that into a Sacrament, which is by him ſet apart to be ſo, and where the party, that is to receive it, is duly qualified for it, accompany his Diſpenſation of it with the Diſpenſation of the Divine Graces; To ſuch of the People again, as receive the Sacrament as they ought, that they ſhall receive together with it, thoſe Graces which it was intended to convey: Thoſe being the ends, for which the former Acts were enjoyn'd, and the Promiſe of Chriſt therefore ſuppoſed to aſſure, that, if thoſe Acts be perform'd, they ſhall become available for them. It will follow laſtly, that, as there is a promiſe of the things before remembred, anſwerably to the ſeveral Acts, which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding part of the Inſtitution enjoyns; ſo that Promiſe being the Promiſe of him, who hath power enough to accompliſh it, and is of too much fidelity, and truth not to fulfill, what he may, it is as little to be doubted, but what he hath ſo promis'd he will not fail to accompliſh, as often as what he enjoyns is perform'd. Which laſt particular I have the rather remark'd, becauſe as the Commands of the Inſtitution cannot make way for the bleſſings of a Sacrament, till they come to be fulfill'd by thoſe, on whom they are impos'd; ſo neither can the promiſes thereof help us to them, till they come to be executed, and appli'd by him, whoſe thoſe Promiſes are: A Promiſe, (becauſe importing only a will to conferr a favour) requiring the reducing of that will to Act, in order to the availableneſs thereof.</p>
                     <p>An account being thus given of that <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of Chriſt, which I have ſaid to be the <hi>foundation</hi> of the relation of a Sacrament, it will not be difficult to ſhew firſt, how <hi>that,</hi> and <hi>each part</hi> thereof contribute to the founding of it. For as that Inſtitution of Chriſt may be conſider'd under a double notion, to wit either as <hi>ſimply ſuch,</hi> or as <hi>executed, and appli'd;</hi> ſo the Inſtitution of Chriſt, in the <hi>former</hi> notion of it, is the more <hi>remote</hi> foundation of it; in the <hi>latter</hi> the more <hi>near,</hi> and immediate. For it being by vertue of Chriſt's Command, as ſuch, that the elements come to be ſet apart by men for the purpoſe of a Sacrament, and by vertue of his own Promiſe, that he himſelf gives them the relation of one; That Inſtitution, which is made up of them, muſt, as ſuch, be thought a <hi>remote</hi> foundation of it, becauſe the foundation of thoſe Acts, which are done by men, and Chriſt toward the producing of it. Again, it being more immediately by what is done by men, that the elements come to be ſo ſet apart, and by what is done, on the other ſide by Chriſt, that they come to have the relation of a Sacrament, the more <hi>near,</hi> and immediate foundation of it muſt be the ſame Inſtitution not conſider'd as ſuch, but as executed, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56517:26"/>appli'd by thoſe, to whom it appertains. From whence as it will follow, that the Inſtitution of Chriſt, and the ſeveral parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of contribute to the founding of this relation by that obedience, which is paid to its commands, and by that completion, which is given to its promiſes, becauſe it is by thoſe means that they are executed, and appli'd; ſo nothing more therefore can be requir'd toward the clearing of it, than to ſhew at once what thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and Promiſes import, becauſe that will let us know what obedience is due to the one, and what completion, or fulfilling to the other.</p>
                     <p>Of the <hi>Commands</hi> of the Inſtitution I have already ſufficiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, and ſhall therefore need only briefly to recapitulate what I have ſaid concerning them. Which, ſo far, as concerns our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe, may be done by ſaying, that they enjoyn in the <hi>general</hi> the Miniſters ſetting apart the elements in order to their becoming a Sacrament, more <hi>particularly</hi> by imploring the bleſſing of God, and Chriſt upon them, or (as the Church hath us'd to expreſs it) the <hi>ſanctification</hi> of them. Which Commands, as they tend rather to prepare the elements to be a Sacrament, than to produce that relation in them (for he, who begs of another the doing of this, or that particular, ſhews the doing of that thing not to belong unto himſelf) ſo will make the Miniſter's compliance with, and execution of them to contribute no farther to the found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that relation, than as that is, by the Inſtitution of Chriſt, to make way for ſome other Act, or Acts, whereby that relation is to be produc'd.</p>
                     <p>From the <hi>Commands</hi> of the Inſtitution therefore, and that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edience which is due to them, paſs we to the Promiſes thereof, and of which alſo I have before given no contemptible account. For which cauſe I ſhall only obſerve here, that there is, among thoſe Promiſes, a Promiſe from Chriſt to the Miniſter, that he will be with him in his miniſtration, and therefore alſo make what he doth, available for thoſe ends, for which it was enjoyn'd; That he will conſequently (becauſe that is the end of his miniſtration in the Conſecration of a Sacrament) make thoſe elements to be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, which were by the Miniſter ſet apart to be ſo; But by what way, and means, as I have not as yet taken upon me to ſhew, ſo I know not whether I ought to be over poſitive in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. I ſhall only repreſent as a thing, which ſeems moſt probable to me, That as God <hi>ſanctifies</hi> our ordinary repaſt by his own word<note n="(q)" place="margin">1 Tim. 4.5.</note>, even by that word of <hi>command,</hi> by which he <hi>made</hi> the creatures to be<note n="(r)" place="margin">Gen. 1.3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> at firſt, and by which he doth as yet <hi>uphold</hi>
                        <note n="(ſ)" place="margin">Heb. 1.3.</note> them, ſo when the elements of a Sacrament are before pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd by Prayer, and ſuch other means as Chriſt himſelf hath preſcrib'd, the ſame God, or rather <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by his appointment, paſſeth his <hi>word of power</hi> upon them, and thereby commands them, not to become actually the conveyers of his Grace (for that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires <hi>another</hi> word of power, or rather his accompanying the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation of them with the Diſpenſation of his Grace) but to be in a readineſs to be ſo. By which means (as was before ſaid) they are fitted for that gracious purpoſe, and accordingly, if they prove not effectual for it, it is not, becauſe <hi>they</hi> were not before
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56517:26"/>ordained and fitted for it, but becauſe the <hi>perſons,</hi> to whom thoſe Sacramental elements are diſpens'd being not duly prepar'd for ſuch a favour, He, who commanded the Sacramental elements to be in a readineſs for it, doth not make uſe of them for it, nor accompany the Diſpenſation of them with the Diſpenſation of his Grace. This I take to be that <hi>Act,</hi> whereby the Inſtitutor of the Chriſtian Sacraments produceth in the elements thereof that Sacramental relation, whereof we ſpeak; But as <hi>whatever</hi> the Act be, by which that relation is produc'd, moſt certain it is that it cannot be any Act of man, ſo it is evident from thence, and from the promiſes of the Inſtitution, that it muſt be ſome <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in purſuance of them, and which whilſt he doth ſo fulfill, he gives birth to that Sacramental relation, which the Act, or Acts of the Miniſter did only make way for, as that too by the ſole force of Chriſt's Commands.</p>
                     <p>The elements being thus inveſted with the relation of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo fitted, <hi>in particular,</hi> to convey the Divine Graces; It remains that the Miniſter diſpenſe them to Gods People in that way and manner, which he hath preſcrib'd, and that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly receive them with thoſe qualifications, which are by the ſame Chriſt required of them. As without the <hi>former</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there can be no hope of the Miniſters approving himſelf unto Chriſt, nor can the people, without <hi>both,</hi> expect to reap that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by them, which they were ſo fitted to convey. For the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and efficacy of Sacraments depending upon the good will of him, that inſtituted them, and not upon any vertue of their own, or the power of him that conſecrates them, neither can men expect any benefit thereby, where there is not a due compliance with his <hi>Laws,</hi> by whom they were ſo inſtituted, and ordain'd. But as if thoſe Laws be compli'd with, there can be no doubt of a happy iſſue, conſidering the Promiſes of Chriſt to the due Adminiſtration, and Reception of them; ſo that is enough to ſhew the <hi>efficacy</hi> thereof, where they are ſo adminiſtred, and receiv'd: There being no doubt of the efficacy of thoſe things, which have the Promiſes of Chriſt to aſſure them, becauſe no doubt at all of his fulfilling thoſe Promiſes, and ſo giving efficacy to the other. And I ſhall only add, that as what is done by the Miniſter toward the producing of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental relation, doth rather make way for it, than actually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it; (this being the proper work of the Inſtitutor of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in purſuance of his own Promiſes:) So the like is to be ſaid, as to the efficacy of the elements, after that relation is produced in them. For though thoſe elements become not effectual for the ends, for which they were appointed, unleſs they be both diſpenſed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as they ought; yet doth that diſpenſation, and reception ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make way for, than give them their reſpective efficacy; It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>God</hi>
                        <note n="(t)" place="margin">Tit. 3.5.</note>, or rather <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by his appointment (and not either the Miniſter, or our ſelves) <hi>which ſaveth us by the waſhing of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and the ſame Chriſt<note n="(u)" place="margin">Eph. 5.26.</note>, who <hi>ſanctifieth, and cleanſeth his Church, by the waſhing of water through the word.</hi> Which will conſequently oblige us to look upon God, and Chriſt as the Authors of the efficacy of Sacraments, as well as of the Sacraments themſelves, and accordingly depend upon them for it, and return them thanks, when we have obtained it.</p>

As to the <hi>former</hi> whereof is ſhewn <hi>firſt,</hi> that there were indeed <hi>ſuch</hi> Sacraments among them, and evidence made thereof, from their enjoying the ſame <hi>Saving Graces,</hi> which our Sacraments pretend to convey, from their being furniſhed alike with <hi>External Symbols</hi> to convey them, and thoſe <hi>Symbols</hi> of God, and Chriſt's inſtitution: <hi>Secondly,</hi> that thoſe Sacraments of theirs were either the <hi>extraordinary</hi> ones they had in their paſſage from <hi>Aegypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan,</hi> as their <hi>Baptiſm</hi> in the Cloud, and in the Sea, and the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> of Manna, and the Water of the Rock, or the <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> ones of <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> and the <hi>Paſsover; Thirdly,</hi> That, though they were of the ſame general nature with the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> yet they differ'd from them, both as to the <hi>manner</hi> of their repreſenting the Divine Graces, which was not ſo <hi>clear,</hi> and as to the <hi>meaſure</hi> of conveyance of them, which was not ſo <hi>full,</hi> as in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. Thoſe <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Sacraments, in the next place, brought under conſideration, and evidence made of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and the Lord's Supper being the only <hi>true,</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> ones, or of <hi>general neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi> to Salvation.</p>

                     <p>But neither will there be leſs evidence concerning their being furniſh'd with certain <hi>external ſions,</hi> to convey from God to them the foremention'd graces. For St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note>, where he affirms the <hi>Jews</hi> to have partaken of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his Graces, affirming in like manner that they did it, as by a <hi>Baptiſm</hi> on the one hand, ſo by <hi>eating,</hi> and <hi>drinking</hi> on the other, muſt conſequently be ſuppoſed to affirm, that they did it by the means of ſuch <hi>ſymbols,</hi> as <hi>our</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are, and therefore alſo, that they were not unfurniſhed with them. Other wiſe there could have been no place for giving the <hi>former</hi> means the name of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and much leſs for expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the <hi>latter</hi> by the terms of <hi>eating,</hi> and <hi>drinking,</hi> or that <hi>drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> again by <hi>drinking of that Rock, which followed them.</hi> For as the foregoing mention of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> which was one of the Chriſtian Sacraments, could not but incline the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to interpret what followed concerning the <hi>Jews eating,</hi> and <hi>drinking,</hi> of a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental</hi> one, eſpecially, when it is alſo affirm'd that they partook of Chriſt by it; ſo much more, when they ſaw the Apoſtle expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that <hi>drinking</hi> by <hi>drinking of that Rock, that followed them,</hi> or rather of the <hi>Water,</hi> that flowed from it. For that being manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an alluſion to the <hi>Water,</hi> that flowed out of that Rock which was ſometime ſmitten<note n="†" place="margin">Numb. 20.11.</note> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by the drinking whereof the <hi>Jews</hi> were a long time ſuſtained; Neither could the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> look upon that <hi>Rock,</hi> to which he alluded, as other than a

                        <hi>figure</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> Nor therefore (conſidering their own Sacraments, as ſuch, which did alſo convey what they were figures of) as other, than ſuch a figure of Chriſt, as convey'd to the believing <hi>Jews</hi> Chriſt's <hi>graces,</hi> and <hi>benefits,</hi> which are the <hi>ſpiritual waters,</hi> that flow from him. <hi>Two</hi> things only there are, that may ſeem to preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice this notion, and which therefore it may not be amiſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider; <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the former Baptiſm is affirmed by St. <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf<note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.2.</note> to have been a <hi>Baptiſm into Moſes,</hi> and not into <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his Graces; Secondly, That what is affirm'd to have been to the <hi>Jews ſpiritual meat,</hi> and <hi>drink,</hi> was alſo their conſtant <hi>temporal</hi> one, and which therefore if we affirm to have been a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Chriſt's graces, and benefits, muſt have made that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to have been as ordinary, as their Meals: Which how the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould be always in a diſpoſition for, is not eaſie to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, and therefore as difficult to believe the Inſtitution of. As touching the former of theſe, even that <hi>Baptiſm</hi>'s being ſtil'd a <hi>Baptiſm into Moſes,</hi> it would not be eaſie to give an account, were it not that the Verſes, which follow, perſwade the deſign of the Apoſtle to have been to ſhew the <hi>Jews</hi> to have enjoyed the ſame Chriſtian Graces with our ſelves: Becauſe the <hi>Baptizing into Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſeems moſt naturally to denote the baptizing into his Religion, as that may ſeem to have been <hi>diſtinguiſh'd from,</hi> and <hi>oppos'd to</hi> that of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> For ſo we know the <hi>Oeconomy of Moſes</hi> is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally taken by the Scriptures<note n="(b)" place="margin">Joh. 1.17.</note>, and ought therefore, if there were nothing to hinder it, to be alike interpreted here. But as the ſame is not to be ſaid, where the deſign of the Apoſtle is to ſhew, that the <hi>Jews</hi> partook with us of the ſame Graces, and Benefits; So nothing there fore can hinder our affixing a like ſenſe to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Baptiſm, if we can give a tolerable account of its being ſaid to be a <hi>Baptiſm into Moſes.</hi> Which may be done by repreſenting it as a Baptiſm into that Oeconomy of our Redemption, which prevailed <hi>under Moſes,</hi> and of which he was the Miniſter of God unto the people, as well as of the Law. For thus the Baptiſm, which <hi>John</hi> adminiſtred, is repreſented as<note n="(c)" place="margin">Matt. 21.25.</note> 
                        <hi>his</hi> Baptiſm, even when it is intimated by our Saviour to have been a Baptiſm <hi>from Heaven,</hi> and ſo more the Baptiſm <hi>of that,</hi> than of the <hi>other.</hi> If therefore there lie any juſt exception againſt the being of theſe Jewiſh Sacraments, it muſt be upon the account of their ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Euchariſt</hi>'s being alſo their <hi>conſtant temporal</hi> food, and which it is not eaſie to imagin they ſhould be always in a diſpoſition for, or therefore believe it was ever intended by God as ſuch. But as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles<note n="(d)" place="margin">Act. 2.46.</note>, that our Euchariſt was almoſt of the ſame ordinary uſage at the firſt, which may take off in ſome meaſure from the force of that Objection; So nothing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders us from believing, that that Meat, and Drink of the <hi>Jews</hi> being deſign'd for a temporal, as well as a Spiritual refreſhment, it might be ſometime, yea, for the moſt part, appointed only for the former (to wit, when the ſatisfying of their bodily neceſſities call'd for their regard) but at other times, though leſs frequently, appointed, and uſed for the latter, and accordingly accompanied with ſuch Prayers, and Praiſes, as were proper for that conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, and receiv'd with alike religious preparations, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56517:29"/>For even the elements of our Euchariſt, though appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt as the Sacrament of his Body, and Blood, yet are not always us'd as ſuch; But only, when they are by God's Prieſts ſet apart for that purpoſe, and his ſpiritual <hi>Benediction,</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked on them.</p>
                     <p>I will conclude what I have to ſay concerning the Being of the former Sacraments, when I have added thereto their being ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for the gracious purpoſes before remembred. Of the <hi>former</hi> whereof as we cannot reaſonably doubt, becauſe nothing leſs than a Divine Inſtitution could make them the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyers of Chriſt's Graces; ſo as little of the <hi>latter,</hi> if we conſider what hath been elſewhere<note n="(e)" place="margin">Expl. of the Creed, in the words, <hi>Our Lord.</hi>
                        </note> ſaid concerning <hi>Chriſt's</hi> governing <hi>even then,</hi> and the Apoſtles exhorting the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after<note n="(f)" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.9.</note>, not to <hi>tempt Chriſt,</hi> as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did, and were <hi>deſtroy'd by Serpents</hi> for it. For as it is not to be imagin'd, how the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> could <hi>tempt Chriſt,</hi> unleſs they had been even then under his conduct; So if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had the conduct of them, there is as little doubt of <hi>his</hi> being the Inſtitutor of their Sacraments, becauſe that was a conſiderable part of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. There being therefore no doubt of the <hi>Being</hi> of <hi>Sacraments</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> which was the firſt thing we propoſed to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; Enquire we in the next place, <hi>what</hi> thoſe their Sacraments were, and which we ſhall find to be either <hi>Extraordinary,</hi> or <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. Extraordinary</hi> thoſe which were juſt before recited, even their being baptized in the Cloud, and in the Sea, and their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of <hi>Manna,</hi> and of the Water of the Rock; <hi>Manna</hi> being no doubt the ſpiritual meat St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, both becauſe their then only repaſt, and <hi>the bread</hi>
                        <note n="(g)" place="margin">Exod. 16.4.</note>, <hi>that came down from Heaven;</hi> As the water of the <hi>Rock</hi> their ſpiritual Drink, and ſo yet more plainly declared by him. And I have the rather given to them the name of <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Sacraments, becauſe as they had them only, during their paſſage through the Wilderneſs; ſo they had them too, when their ordinary Sacraments ceaſed, which is the proper ſeaſon for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ones. As will appear if we can ſhew (what I ſhall by and by endeavour) that <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> and the <hi>Paſsover</hi> were their ordinary ones; It being certain from the Book of <hi>Joſhua</hi>
                        <note n="(h)" place="margin">Joſh. 5.5.</note>, that, from the time of the Iſraelites going out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> till their coming to <hi>Gilgal,</hi> none of the Iſraelites were circumciſed, and as certain too from the ſame place<note n="(i)" place="margin">Joſh. 5.10.</note>, that they had not till then any <hi>Paſsover;</hi> That, as it is the firſt time wherein the obſervation of it is mention'd after their coming out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> ſo being the firſt time alſo, wherein they were in a capacity to obſerve it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not till then furniſhed, or at leaſt not ordinarily, with that earthly Bread, wherewith their <hi>Paſsover</hi> was required to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd.</p>
                     <p>From thoſe their Extraordinary Sacraments therefore paſs we to their Ordinary ones, and which as I have already intimated to be <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> and the <hi>Paſsover,</hi> ſo I muſt now manifeſt to be ſo, but it muſt be by other Arguments, than are commonly alledged for it. For as for what is alledged from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s repreſenting the <hi>Circumciſion of Abraham</hi>
                        <note n="(k)" place="margin">Tom. 4.11.</note> as a <hi>Seal of that righteouſneſs, which he had being yet uncircumciſed,</hi> it ſeems to me to make nothing at
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56517:29"/>all for it; Becauſe (as was before<note n="(l)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Supra</hi> Part II.</note> ſhewn) rather intended to denote God's approbation of his particular Righteouſneſs, than any declaration of the nature of the thing it ſelf. But as therefore I cannot ſee, what can be argued from thence toward proving Circumciſion to have been a Sacrament; So I ſhall chuſe rather to evince it from the Inſtitution of it, as where, if any where, the deſign thereof is moſt clearly ſet down. Now the firſt thing obſervable from thence is, that Circumciſion was a <hi>Sign,</hi> as our Sacraments are, and <hi>ſo far</hi> therefore of the nature of them. For <hi>this</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>ſhall be</hi> a ſign, or <hi>token</hi>
                        <note n="(m)" place="margin">Gen. 17.10.</note> 
                        <hi>of the Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and you;</hi> That is to ſay, as was before<note n="(n)" place="margin">Gen. 17.7.</note> expreſs'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>God</hi> on the one hand, and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>his Seed</hi> on the other. It is alike obſervable, ſecondly, that as Circumciſion was a ſign, yea a ſign of that Covenant, which God then propos'd between himſelf, and the foremention'd perſons; So it was ſuch a ſign too, as was alſo of the Eſſence of it, and till the paſſing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it was not to be look'd upon as ſtruck. Which I gather not only from its being ſtil'd a <hi>Covenant</hi>
                        <note n="(o)" place="margin">Gen. 17.10.</note>, as well as a ſign of it, yea more often a <hi>Covenant,</hi> than the other, but from God's affirming it to be <hi>that</hi> Covenant, which ought to be kept<note n="(p)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> between him, and them, and accordingly repreſenting the neglecters of it, as thoſe which had <hi>broken</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 17.14.</note> 
                        <hi>his Covenant.</hi> From whence as it will follow, that it had a more intimate relation to the Covenant, than that of a bare ſign, or token; So it muſt be either that, which was to ſtrike the Covenant between them, and ſo make it actually ſuch as to thoſe perſons that receiv'd it, or one of thoſe things, which were to be obſerv'd after the Covenant was ſtruck between them, and for which it was enter'd into. But as it appears from thoſe words of God, which uſher in the mention of this Covenant, that the thing ſo agreed upon was a matter of much more weight, even their <hi>walking before God, and being perfect;</hi> So we are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in reaſon to reſolve Circumciſion to be that, which was to ſtrike the Covenant between God, and them, and make it actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch, as to thoſe perſons that receiv'd it. From whence as it will follow farther, becauſe ſtriking the Covenant between God, and them, that it enſur'd to thoſe, that receiv'd it, the future Bleſſings of it, and ſo might not unreaſonably be repreſented as a <hi>Seal</hi> or a <hi>Pledge</hi> of them; So that it put them into actual poſſeſſion of ſuch Bleſſings, as were preſently to be beſtow'd, if there were really any ſuch, and accordingly was no leſs a <hi>means of conveying</hi> them. Which will conſequently leave nothing more to enqui e, than whether that Covenant aſſur'd the ſame Bleſſings with the Chriſtian, and whether any of thoſe Bleſſings were to be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately beſtow'd by vertue of it. For if that Covenant aſſur'd the ſame Bleſſings with the Chriſtian, then had the ſign thereof rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſame inward Graces with ours, and ſo far forth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore agreed with them; And if any of thoſe Bleſſings were to be immediately beſtow'd, it was alſo a conveyer of them, and ſo yet more perfectly the ſame. Now that that Covenant, of which Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was a ſign, aſſur'd the ſame Bleſſings with the Chriſtian ſeems to me to be ſufficiently evident from it's being affirmed<note n="(q)" place="margin">Gen. 17.7.</note> to import, that <hi>God would be a God to Abraham,</hi> and <hi>to his Seed after
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56517:30"/>him.</hi> For that implying at leaſt, that he would be as gracious to him, as he was before, and conſequently (becauſe God dealt with him ſo before) that he would <hi>count his Faith to him for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> it muſt alſo be thought to import his aſſuring the ſame Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings with the Chriſtian Covenant, becauſe that is the ſumm, and ſubſtance of them all. All therefore, that we have farther to ſhew, is, That ſome at leaſt of thoſe Bleſſings were, by vertue of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant it ſelf, to be immediately beſtow'd on thoſe, who entred into it, which will be no hard matter to evince. For thus much at leaſt it muſt be thought to import, that if the party to be Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed receiv'd his Circumciſion with that Faith, which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him, that Faith of his ſhould from that very inſtant be accounted to him for Righteouſneſs: Becauſe, the Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo far perform'd on his part, there muſt enſue a like completion on the part of God, as which otherwiſe he could not have been ſaid to be punctual to, nor approv'd himſelf a God to the party in Covenant with him. And tho' we cannot make the like Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence upon the part of Children, becauſe there was nothing of Faith in them to procure them ſuch an Imputation; Yet in as much as they were admitted into the ſame Covenant with their believing Parents, and, as they could bring nothing more toward the procuring the Bleſſings of it, than their external Circumciſion, ſo they had nothing more required of them, It is but reaſonable to believe, that they receiv'd the ſame Benefits by it, and had their Circumciſion imputed to them for it. Such Evidence there is for Circumciſion's being a Sacrament, yea of the ſame general nature with the Chriſtian ones; And I no way doubt we ought to think the ſame of the Feaſt of the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> if not alſo of many of their other Sacrifices: Not, it may be, for any particular evidence there is from the Inſtitution of it, or them, but from the relation they bore to Chriſt's Sacrifice upon the Croſs, and the care it appears God took to convey the Benefits of Chriſt's Sacrifice by thoſe extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Sacraments, which he gave them in the Wilderneſs. For the Sacrifices before mention'd being equally ſigns of that of Chriſt, yea intended by God to remit men<note n="(†)" place="margin">See Expl. of the <hi>Creed,</hi> in the word, <hi>Dead.</hi>
                        </note> to him; It is but reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to believe, that God made the ſame uſe of them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed Chriſt, and his Benefits by them. Otherwiſe their condition in the Land of <hi>Cana an</hi> would have been worſe, than in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe as ſoon as they entred that, their extraordinary Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments ceaſed.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Only as it is not to be thought, that thoſe Sacraments, tho' the ſame in ſubſtance with ours, did yet agree with them in all other particulars, becauſe belonging to a Diſpenſation, which was manifeſtly inferiour to the Chriſtian; So there are two things, wherein they differ'd from ours, and by which they will appear to have fallen ſhort of them: Firſt, That they did not ſo clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the things they were intended to ſignifie, Secondly, That they did not convey, what they ſo ſignified, in ſo ample a manner. For beſide that thoſe ſignifications of theirs were rather hinted, than plainly expreſſed, and much leſs ſo plainly expreſs'd, as the deſigns of the Chriſtian Sacraments; Thoſe ſignifications were not a little obſcur'd by the concomitancy of others, and which they
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56517:30"/>were equally obliged to intend. For thus <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> becauſe a ſign of that Covenant, by which God did equally oblige him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to poſſeſs <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his natural Seed of the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> was a ſign of God's giving them that promiſed Land, as well as the righeouſneſs of Faith, and that Heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> which belonged to it. And thus too the Paſſover was a ſign of that People's Aegyptian Servitude, and God's delivering them from it, as well as Chriſt's delivering them from the ſlavery of Sin, and Satan, by the ſhedding of his Blood. By which means it is eaſie to ſee, that theſe latter, and more noble ſignifications of them muſt have been yet more obſcured to them, and ſo adminiſter leſs Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Conſolation to them. This I take to be one ſignal difference between the Jewiſh Sacraments, and ours, and wherein therefore they muſt be thought to fall far ſhort of what we now enjoy. But that it is not the only material difference between them, will appear if we conſider the preference the Scripture gives to that Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, under which we are, above that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or <hi>Abraham;</hi> And that exuberance of Grace, which was poured out upon the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracers of the Chriſtian Diſpenſation, and of which we find no footſteps under the other. For that is enough to ſhew, that though the Jewiſh Sacraments convey'd the ſame Spiritual Benefits; yet they did not do it in that proportion, wherein the Chriſtian did, and ſo fell yet ſhorter of them. Which will not only oblige us to ſet ſo much the greater value upon <hi>our own</hi> Sacraments, but be the more curious in enquiring, what ought to be look'd upon as ſuch, which is that I am in the next place to intend.</p>
                     <p>For the reſolution whereof we are to know (what we need go no farther than our own Homilies<note n="(x)" place="margin">Hom. of Com. Pray. and Sacram.</note> for the underſtanding) that the word <hi>Sacrament</hi> may be taken either in a more <hi>lax</hi> and <hi>general,</hi> or in a more <hi>ſtrict</hi> and <hi>particular</hi> acceptation. If we take it in the former of theſe, ſo the number of the Chriſtian Sacraments will be found to be much greater, than even the Romaniſts themſelves have made it: Becauſe (as our Homily obſerves) <hi>in a general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception the name of a Sacrament may,</hi> and hath been <hi>attributed to any thing, whereby an holy thing is ſignifi'd.</hi> Whence it is (as the ſame <hi>Homily</hi> goes on) that <hi>Ancient Writers have given that Name, not only to thoſe Five,</hi> which have been added by the Papiſts, <hi>but alſo to divers, and ſundry Ceremonies, as to Oyl, waſhing of Feet, and ſuch like.</hi> But as the Queſtion between us, and the Papiſts, even in their own<note n="(ſ)" place="margin">Conc. Trid. Seſſ. <hi>7.</hi> can. <hi>1.</hi>
                        </note> way of ſtating it, is not what may in a more <hi>lax,</hi> and <hi>general</hi> ſenſe be look'd upon as Sacraments, but what are <hi>ſtrictly,</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> ſuch, ſo that Queſtion cannot better be voided, than by examining thoſe things, which pretend to that dignity by the account we have before given of the Nature of a Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>Of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> I ſhall ſay nothing at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, partly becauſe there is no Controverſie at all concerning their being truly, and properly Sacraments, and partly becauſe we have no other certain means of judging of the Nature of Sacraments, but by that, which is obſervable concerning <hi>them.</hi> Our buſineſs muſt therefore be to examin the other Five by them, and by what we have before obſerv'd, concerning the Nature of a Sacrament, from them.</p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:56517:31"/>
                     <p>To begin with <hi>Confirmation,</hi> becauſe the firſt Religious Rite after Baptiſm, and becauſe of all the <hi>Five</hi> beſt deſerving the name of a Sacrament. A Rite, which as our Church receives, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns, ſo the more ſober ſort of Proteſtants allow to have been an Inſtitution of the Apoſtles, and ſuch as is of ſignal uſe to thoſe, who were baptiz'd in their Infancy, by that examination, which is to precede it, and thoſe ſolemn Prayers, that do attend it. But as the thing it ſelf doth not appear to me to have been inſtituted by Chriſt, which, even by the Doctrine of the <hi>Trent</hi> Council<note n="(t)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> is made a Character of a Sacrament, ſo there is yet leſs appearance of its having any outward ſign, to which the bleſſings thereof may be ſuppoſed to have been annex'd, which is of the very Eſſence of a Sacrament: That, which was at firſt adminiſtred by a bare Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands, and afterwards by the addition of the Chriſm, coming at length to be perform'd by the ſole ceremony of Unction, as the practice of the Greek, and Latine Church declares. Of which variation what account can be given, but that the Church it ſelf did at firſt look upon the Rites of Confirmation as arbitrary, and conſequently not of the ſame nature with the ſigns of Baptiſm, and the Lord's Supper. For whatever additions, or variations came afterwards to be made in theſe, the Water of the one, and the Bread, and Wine in the other were ever preſerved in them.</p>
                     <p>The next ſuppoſed Sacrament is that of <hi>Penance,</hi> or rather (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the form thereof is by themſelves<note n="(u)" place="margin">Conc. Trid. Seſſ. 14. c. 13.</note> made to conſiſt in <hi>Ego abſolvo te,</hi> &amp;c.) the Sacrament of Abſolution. An Inſtitution, which we willingly acknowledge to be an Inſtitution of Chriſt, and which our Church moreover confeſſeth<note n="(w)" place="margin">Hom. of Com. Pray. and Sacr.</note> to have the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the forgiveneſs of ſins. But differs from a Sacrament in this, that it hath not that promiſe annexed, and tyed to the uſual viſible ſign thereof, even Impoſition of hands. For for the uſe of any ſuch viſible ſign in it we find no Command, and much leſs any declaration from Chriſt, that it ſhould not be available, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it were convey'd by it, or made to depend upon the uſage of it.</p>
                     <p>But it may be much more may be ſaid for that, which they call the Sacrament of <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> becauſe affirmed by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent</hi>
                        <note n="(x)" place="margin">Seſſ. 14. can. 1.</note> to have been inſtituted by our <hi>Lord,</hi> and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed to the World by St. <hi>James.</hi> And I no way doubt, that when our Saviour ſent forth his Diſciples by two, and two<note n="(y)" place="margin">Mark 6.7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note>, he gave them power to <hi>anoint ſick perſons,</hi> as well as to caſt out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Spirits, and, it may be too, commanded them, for that time, to make uſe of that particular ceremony toward the healing of them. I as little doubt, for the mention that is made of it in St. <hi>James</hi>
                        <note n="(z)" place="margin">James 5.14.</note>, that the ſame ceremony of Unction was continued in the Church, and perhaps preſcrib'd by other Apoſtles, as well as by him, to the Governours of the Church. But it doth not appear to me to have been intended by Chriſt for perpetual uſe, and much leſs for thoſe purpoſes, for which it is alledged. For if it were intended by Chriſt for perpetual uſe, how came the ſame Chriſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to thoſe that believe, that if they only <hi>laid hands</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Mark 16.18.</note> 
                        <hi>on</hi> the ſick they ſhould recover? How came he to give his Apoſtles power to cure diſeaſes by the uſe of that <hi>only ceremony,</hi> as in the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56517:31"/>caſe of <hi>Publius</hi>
                        <note n="†" place="margin">Act. 28.8.</note>, by <hi>taking infirm people by the hand</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 3.5.</note>, yea by their bare<note n="(a)" place="margin">Act. 9.34.</note> word? This being to give encouragement to the neglect of his own Commands, if the ceremony of Unction were to be look'd upon as ſuch. Though granting that Ceremony to have been intended for perpetual uſe, what appearance is there of its having been intended for the purpoſes of a Sacrament, yea to procure, in an eſpecial manner, the forgiveneſs of ſins? For all that St. <hi>Mark</hi> ſays concerning the Apoſtles anointing with Oyl is, that they thereby healed<note n="(b)" place="margin">Mark 6.13.</note> thoſe they did ſo anoint; Yea it is, if not the only, yet the principal thing St. <hi>James</hi> aſſures to thoſe, whom he enjoyn'd the uſe of it. As it appears by his uſhering it in as an application to be made to ſick perſons, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing that that Prayer, which went along with it, ſhould ſave the ſick, and procure God's raiſing of them, in fine by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting men to confeſs their faults one to another, that they might be healed. For theſe things ſhew plainly, that if the healing of ſick perſons was not the only thing intended, yet it was at leaſt the principal one. But ſo the Church it ſelf appears to have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood this ceremony, as is evident, among other things, from that Prayer, which did accompany it: That, as <hi>Caſſander</hi>

One only paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage there is in St. <hi>James,</hi> which may ſeem to give this Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of anointing a higher, and a far better deſign; even his affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that that prayer, which did accompany it, ſhould procure for the ſick perſon alſo, that <hi>if he had committed ſins</hi>
                        <note n="(e)" place="margin">James 5.15.</note>, <hi>they ſhould be forgiven him.</hi> But beſide that St. <hi>James</hi> doth not attribute that forgiveneſs to the ceremony of Unction, but to the prayer that attended, or followed it; The deſign of the Elders viſitation of the Sick being no doubt to procure as well their Spiritual, as Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral health, it is not unreaſonable to think, that that very Prayer, which they made over them, did not only aim at God's accompanying the former ceremony with the bleſſing, for which it was intended, but extend farther to the imploring for them all thoſe ſpiritual bleſſings, which they wanted, and particularly perfect remiſſion, and forgiveneſs. Which if it did, as is but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to believe, that Oyl cannot be thought to have had any intereſt in it, and much leſs to have been eſpecially intended as the Sacrament thereof. And indeed, as there are no footſteps in that Antiquity, which is truly primitive, of any ſuch Unction of ſick perſons in order to their ſpiritual welfare; As there is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56517:32"/>moreover in it of another kind of treatment, and particularly of the Elders of the Church giving unto thoſe,<note place="margin">Dionyſ. Alex. apud Euſeb. Eccl. Hiſt. li. 6. c. 44. item Conc. Nic. can. 13.</note> that were under penance the Sacrament of Chriſt's Body, and Blood, as their laſt, and neceſſary <hi>Viaticum;</hi> So I ſee not what neceſſity there is of any ſuch Sacrament as <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> to confer upon ſick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons the remiſſion of ſins, or other ſuch like graces, as they may ſtand in need of; There being place, even in them, for the Abſolution of the Church, and the Sacrament of Chriſt's Body and Blood.

As appears in part from its being joyned in St. <hi>Mark</hi>
                        <note n="(h)" place="margin">Mark 6.13.</note> with the <hi>caſting out of Devils,</hi> but more from our Saviours ranking the <hi>laying on of hands</hi> upon the ſick (which was but another way of adminiſtring it) with<note n="(i)" place="margin">Mark 16.17, 18.</note> the ſame <hi>caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of Devils, ſpeaking new tongues,</hi> and <hi>the taking up of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents.</hi> For if theſe be to be look'd upon as extraordinary gifts, there is equal reaſon to believe, the <hi>anointing,</hi> or laying on of hands upon the ſick to have been of the ſame order. Sure I am <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
                        <note n="(k)" place="margin">Tert. ad Scapnlam cap. 4.</note> doth not only rank the gift of <hi>healing,</hi> even in his time, with the <hi>caſting out of Devils,</hi> but makes mention of one <hi>Proculus</hi> a Chriſtian adminiſtring this ſuppoſed Sacrament to <hi>Severus</hi> the Emperor, yea curing him by the Oyl of it.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> therefore paſs we to that, which they call the Sacrament of <hi>Orders,</hi> and which is not only affirm'd by the <hi>Trent</hi> Council to be a true<note n="(l)" place="margin">Seſſ. 13.

                           <hi>Ib.</hi> cap. 3.</note> grace, as the moſt undoubted Sacraments do. It is not my purpoſe, nor was it ever the purpoſe of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to detract in the leaſt from the force of that, which they entitle the Sacrament of Orders. But that it hath not the nature of a true, and proper Sacrament, will appear in the firſt place from its not having by the Inſtitution of Chriſt any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſign, to which the grace thereof may be ſuppoſed to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed. For if it had, it muſt have been the external ſign, or ceremony of <hi>breathing on</hi> the perſons to be ordain'd; This being the only one, which our Saviour<note n="(n)" place="margin">Joh. 20.22.</note> made uſe of, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd the power of <hi>Order</hi> upon his Apoſtles. But ſo far were the Apoſtles, or the ſucceeding Church from making uſe of that, that we find them, on the contrary, to have made uſe of Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hands, yea to have entitled the <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>Orders</hi>
                        <note n="(o)" place="margin">1 Tim. 4.14. 2 Tim. 1.6.</note> in a more eſpecial manner to it. Whether it were, that they took their pattern therein from the known uſage of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and which we find our Saviour himſelf to have followed in other inſtances, or (which I rather think) that they were directed to it by that ſpirit of God, which guided them in all their actions, and to whoſe guidance, and inſtruction our Saviour had left them after his being taken from them. Sure I am there are no footſteps of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſign in the firſt Inſtitution of it (as there was, in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> of their <hi>proper</hi> ones) nor any appearance from Scripture of any after command of Chriſt
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56517:32"/>concerning it. But becauſe the external ſign of Ordination, though none of our Saviours Inſtitution, yet is confeſſed by our ſelves to have had a legitimate one; Therefore enquire we in the ſecond place, whether, after the manner of other Sacraments, it be a <hi>means</hi> of Grace, or (as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> love to ſpeak) have the <hi>power of conferring</hi> it. A thing, which ſeems to them ſufficiently evident, not only from that form of words<note n="(p)" place="margin">Joh. 20.22.</note>, wherewith by the preſcript of Chriſt it hath been always attended, even <hi>receive ye the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> but from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s willing <hi>Timothy</hi> in one place<note n="(q)" place="margin">1 Tim. 4.14.</note> 
                        <hi>not to neglect that gift,</hi> or grace, <hi>which was given</hi> with it, and in another<note n="(r)" place="margin">2 Tim. 1.6.</note> to <hi>ſtir up that gift,</hi> or Grace <hi>of God, which was in him by the laying on of his hands.</hi> And thus much I willingly yield to the force of the foremention'd Texts, that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> ever was, and ſtill is conferr'd upon thoſe men, who are rightly ordain'd by the Governours of the Church. But in what meaſure, and to what purpoſes is the thing in queſtion between us, and particularly whether it is conferr'd, as to its <hi>ſanctifying,</hi> and <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> Graces, which I have ſhewn elſewhere<note n="(ſ)" place="margin">Supra, Part 3.</note> to be the proper graces of a Sacrament. Now what is there in any, or all the foremention'd Texts, to evince that, which they call the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Orders</hi> to confer ſuch graces upon the perſon Ordain'd? If we enquire, as to the firſt of them<note n="(t)" place="margin">Joh. 20.22.</note>, even that Text which makes Orders to exhibit the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> the utmoſt that can be inferr'd from thence is ſuch an exhibition of it, as may be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for the party ordain'd to <hi>remit,</hi> or <hi>retain ſins,</hi> as for which<note n="(u)" place="margin">Joh. 20.23.</note>, and which alone it is profeſſed to be beſtow'd. But ſo ſure the perſon ordain'd may be qualifi'd to do, without the ſanctifying graces of God's Spirit, even in the opinion of the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers themſelves: It being their opinion<note n="(w)" place="margin">Seſſ. 7. can. 12.</note>, as well as ours<note n="(x)" place="margin">Art. of Rel. 26.</note>, that the perſonal qualifications of the Miniſter do neither add to, nor detract from the force of the Sacraments they diſpenſe. But as therefore no ſuch ſanctifying graces can be ſuppos'd to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd, though we make the Text to import ſuch an exhibition of the Holy Ghoſt, as is requiſite for the remitting, or retaining of ſins; ſo much leſs, if nothing more were meant by <hi>Receive ye the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> than receive ye Authority from him ſo to do. Which that there was not is at leaſt probable from his referring them to another time<note n="(y)" place="margin">Act. 1.4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> for the <hi>other powers</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt, yea bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them not to expect them, till after his aſcenſion<note n="(z)" place="margin">Joh. 16.7.</note> into Heaven. For that ſuppoſeth them to have been as yet without thoſe powers of the Holy Ghoſt, and conſequently that Chriſt meant no more by <hi>Receive ye the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> than receive ye of his <hi>Authority,</hi> to whom the power of the Church is committed under me, as ye ſhall in due time of ſuch abilities, and gifts, as may fit you for the exerciſe thereof. And if that were the ſenſe, yea only ſenſe of thoſe words of Chriſt, which contain both the Exemplar, and Inſtitution of Ordination, I know not why we ſhould ſuppoſe that, which they call the Sacrament of Orders, to have a farther deſign in it ſelf, than to communicate a Ghoſtly Authority to thoſe, on whom it is beſtow'd. But let us ſuppoſe, that ſomething more was meant by theſe words, than <hi>Receive ye a Ghoſtly Authority,</hi> or, at leaſt, that it was the intention of our
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56517:33"/>Saviour (becauſe of what we read<note n="*" place="margin">1 Tim. 4.14. 2 Tim. 1.16.</note> concerning <hi>Timothy</hi>) that ſomething more ſhould be afterwards intended by them, when no Apoſtolical <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> was to enſue, even the communicating of gifts and graces, as well as a Ghoſtly Authority. Yet even ſo it will not follow, that an exhibition of <hi>Sanctifying,</hi> and <hi>Saving</hi> Graces was intended, or that even <hi>Timothy</hi> receiv'd any ſuch Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by it. For who knows not that there are <hi>Gratiae gratis datae,</hi> as well as <hi>Gratum facientes,</hi> yea that the word<note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 12.6. 1 Cor. 1.7. 1 Cor. 12.4. 1 Cor. 12.9. 1 Cor. 12.28. 1 Cor. 12.30.</note>

Who knows not, that thoſe <hi>Gratiae gratis datae</hi> are more proper for the Miniſterial Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, than the other can be ſuppos'd to be, yea that they may avail for thoſe ſpiritual purpoſes, for which that Function was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended? In fine, who knows not, that God hath appointed other Sacraments for the conveying of his ſanctifying Graces, and by the participation of which therefore they might be more reaſonably expected? For theſe things being ſuppos'd, there will not only be no neceſſity of underſtanding St. <hi>Paul</hi> of the ſanctifying Graces of God's Spirit, but not ſo much as any probable reaſon for it. Though granting thirdly, that there were alſo <hi>ſome ſanctifying Graces</hi> attending it; Yet as we cannot for the reaſons before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd underſtand any other ſanctifying Graces, than what may ſerve more immediately for the diſcharge of the Miniſterial Function, ſuch as is a <hi>holy Zeal</hi> for the welfare of thoſe Souls, which are committed to thoſe that are of it, ſo we can much leſs (as our <hi>Homily</hi>

From all which put together it is evident, that if judgment be to be made of Sacraments by Baptiſm, and the Lord's Supper, Orders will hardly paſs for one of them; As which varies ſo much from them both in the External Sign, and in the Graces, which are ſignified by it.</p>
                     <p>One only Inſtitution remains of thoſe, which have the name of Sacraments, and which if they, who ſo entitled it, would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand only in a general ſenſe, they would not find our Church diſſenting from them, becauſe affirming<note n="(a)" place="margin">The form of Solemn. of Matrim.</note>

It hath no certain external ſign, as other Sacraments have, to confer that grace, which is ſuppoſed to belong to it; It hath no other promiſe of Grace belonging to it, than may be ſuppoſed to belong to any
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56517:33"/>ſtate of life, which a Man ſhall ſet himſelf to, with a due reſpect to the Commands of God, and uſe with that care, and ſobriety, that becomes him.

And if it hath not, nothing can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige us to look upon it as a true, and proper Sacrament, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed but in the ſame degree, wherewith their other Sacraments are.

                     <p>But becauſe it may be demanded, how, if there be but two ſtrict, and proper Sacraments, ſeveral other things ſhould come to have the ſame name, and honour, and particularly how the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould at length advance them to the number of <hi>Seven</hi> (this ſeeming to be ſome prejudice againſt our aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only <hi>two</hi>) I anſwer firſt by reaſon of their general cognation with them, and which we know, in other things, to procure the ſame name to things, that are of a very diſſerent nature. Whence it is, that (as was before obſerv'd out of one of our own<note n="(f)" place="margin">Hom. of Com. Pray. and Sacram.</note> 
                        <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies</hi>) not only thoſe <hi>five,</hi> which we but now mention'd, have obtain'd the name of Sacraments, but whatſoever, in a manner, hath been made uſe of to ſignine a holy thing. Which is ſo true, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> in one place<note n="(g)" place="margin">De Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mâ cap. 9.</note> gives the name of Sacrament to <hi>Dreams,</hi> and <hi>Viſions,</hi> and in others<note n="(h)" place="margin">De pudic. c. 9. &amp; adv.

For though, it may be, they had not the ceremonies now in uſe, or at leaſt had not that number of them, wherewith they are now encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd, yet wanted they not ſome, or other, which was of the ſame ſymbolical nature, and particularly <hi>Impoſition of hands.</hi> For that, as we learn from the Scripture, they made uſe of in <hi>Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi>

But beſide that general, and external cognati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is between Sacraments, and Sacramentals (for ſo I ſhall for the future entitle thoſe things, which are not ſtrict, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ones) there is alſo, as to ſome of the latter, a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and intimate cognation, but eſpecially as to thoſe, which are before remembred, and are by the Papiſts advanc'd into true, and proper Sacraments. For ſetting aſide that, which they call the <hi>Sacrament of Marriage,</hi> and which hath, even among them, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the name, than nature of one; There is none of the other four, which tend not to the conferring of ſome Divine Grace, or Benefit, as well as to the ſignification of it. For thus <hi>Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> tends to procure a farther addition of God's ſanctifying Graces, and ſo to ſtrengthen, and perfect the perſon, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers himſelf unto it; And thus the Oyl of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> as us'd of Old, toward the procuring of the Grace of health, and the removal of the ſick perſons guilt ſo far, as was neceſſary for the procuring
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56517:34"/>of the other. Thus <hi>Abſolution</hi> tends to the procuring of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of the Penitent, and <hi>Ordination,</hi> for the perſon or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd, of a ſpiritual, and ghoſtly Authority, if not alſo of ſuch ſpiritual gifts, as are neceſſary for the exerciſe thereof. By which means as they approach yet nearer to the nature of true, and proper Sacraments, ſo it is the leſs to be wonder'd at, that they ſhould obtain the name of Sacraments, yea have the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch in a more eminent manner, than other Sacramentals had: Eſpecially if we conſider thirdly, that thoſe five ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sacraments are upon the matter the only noted Acts, that are adminiſtred by the Church, or, at leaſt, that are attended with ſuch Rites, and Ceremonies. For ſo it is yet leſs difficult to believe, that they might not only come by degrees to be rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Baptiſm, and the Lord's Supper, but together with them to be accounted, if not the only, yet at leaſt the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary ones. Which <hi>Peter Lombard</hi>
                        <note n="(o)" place="margin">Sentent. li. 4. Diſtinct. 2.</note> taking notice of, made the Number of Chriſtian Sacraments to be neither more, nor leſs than <hi>ſeven,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſway'd by him, did afterwards Authoritatively confirm. This I take to have been the true Original of that number, to which the Sacraments are now advanc'd, and not either any cogent arguments for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſo many, or indeed any firm belief, even in that Church it ſelf, that they ought all to be look'd upon as true, and proper ones. And I am yet more confirm'd in that belief by the ſilence there was<note n="(p)" place="margin">Conſult. Caſſandri ad Art. 13.</note> before <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> of any certain, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate number, and by the Authority of two of the greateſt <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> of the Latin Church: St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in his tract <hi>de Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> and in another <hi>de iis qui myſteriis initiantur,</hi> mentioning only Baptiſm, and the Lord's Supper, and St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> not only reſolving<note n="(q)" place="margin">Epiſt. 118. ad Januar.</note> the Sacraments to be <hi>numero pauciſſima,</hi> and mentioning none but thoſe, but affirming elſewhere<note n="(r)" place="margin">De Doctr. Chriſt. li. 3. cap. 9.</note>, that our Lord, and the Apoſtolical diſcipline had delivered <hi>ſome few; ſuch as is the Sacrament of Baptiſm, and the celebration of Chriſt's Body, and Blood.</hi> For that is enough to ſhew, that though the <hi>Fathers</hi> might ſometime mention the other Inſtitutions under the notion of Sacraments, yet they look'd upon Baptiſm, and the Lord's Supper as the only true, and proper ones, or, at leaſt, were not over confident of the being ſo of the other. If the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath ſince arriv'd at a greater confidence, it will concern her, rather than us to give an account of it; But however not ſo far concern us, as to remove us from an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which ſeems to us to be built upon ſolid, and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial grounds. For either ſhe hath arriv'd at that confidence by the means before declar'd, and then her Authority will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry incompetent; Or ſhe hath arriv'd at it by ſome other means, which we are not acquainted with, and which therefore we cannot be ſuppos'd to be influenced by till ſhe ſhall be pleaſed to declare them.</p>
                     <p>I have inſiſted thus long upon the <hi>Number</hi> of the Chriſtian Sacraments, not becauſe I was obliged to it by my more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate task (for our <hi>Catechiſm</hi> contents it ſelf to declare, that there are <hi>two only as generally neceſſary to Salvation</hi>) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56517:34"/>our Church affirms elſewhere<note n="(ſ)" place="margin">Art. of Rel. 25. and Homily of Com. Pr. and Sacram.</note>, that there are but two ſtrict, and proper ones, and becauſe the joyning of others with them in the ſame rank, and order of Sacraments may help in time to bring them into leſs repute; It being natural for men, where there are ſeveral means tending to the ſame end, either to adhere to ſome of them to the utter rejecting of the other, or to uſe thoſe others with leſs preparation, and reſpect. And whether this be not the caſe of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> where that, which they call the Sacrament of <hi>Penance</hi> is ſo much in vogue, may be judg'd of by the little care they take to fit themſelves for the one, where they have obtain'd, as they eaſily may, the abſolution of the other. And I ſhall only add, that if our Church did not diſtinguiſh in the preſent Catechiſm between proper, and improper Sacraments, it was not, as I conceive, becauſe ſhe had departed from her own <hi>Articles,</hi> and <hi>Homilies,</hi> but becauſe, being to inſtruct thoſe, who were no proper Auditors of higher matters, ſhe contented her ſelf to let them know, what was ſufficient for their purpoſe, that there were but <hi>two, that were generally neceſſary to Salvation,</hi> even Baptiſm and the Supper of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Now that there are no more than theſe, that are <hi>generally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation,</hi> (which is all, that remains for me to demonſtrate) will appear if we reflect upon thoſe, which have been added to them by the Papiſts, and ranked in the ſame order with them. For who can think <hi>Marriage</hi> to be ſuch, who believe, as the Papiſts do, that it is unlawful to the whole Order of Prieſthood, yea who know that there are not a few, who live not long enough to deſire, or need it, or are otherwiſe ſufficiently fortified by God againſt any neceſſity of eſpouſing it? Who can believe <hi>Orders</hi> to be ſuch, when there ever was, and ever will be a greater number of thoſe, who are to be inſtructed, than there was, or ever will be of thoſe, who are to inſtruct them? In fine, who can believe the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> of the ſick to be ſuch, when it appears by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer diſcourſe to have had no other deſign, than the recovery of them from their infirmities? For well may that be look'd upon, as not generally neceſſary to Salvation, which appears not to have been intended to miniſter at all unto it. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there be any of the five of that neceſſity, it muſt be <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,</hi> and <hi>Abſolution,</hi> but which how <hi>uſeful</hi> ſoever they may be, and are ſo eſteemed by our ſelves, yet will not be found to be any more than ſuch. I alledge as to the <hi>former</hi> of theſe the no precept there appears concerning it, which is one of thoſe things, which induce a neceſſity to Salvation; And I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge too (which is another) the no appearance there is of any tendency in it to procure ſome bleſſings, for which no other means are appointed. For the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> having for its end the confirming and ſtrengthning of our Graces, which is all that <hi>Confirmation,</hi> as now in uſe, profeſſeth to intend; neither can there be any neceſſity of the means to oblige us to the uſe of the latter, or endanger our Salvation by the omiſſion of it.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56517:35"/>In fine, I alledge, what is with me of no ſmall moment, the no mention there is in <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi>

For though that Father doth not obſcurely intimate, that they had a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar regard in their Prayers to the welfare of the new Baptized perſon, as well as to the more general welfare of the other; Yet he takes no notice at all of any Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands upon him, or any other ceremony, that may be ſuppoſed to be analogous to it. Which in all probability he would have done, (eſpecially when he mention'd the Kiſs of Peace, as well as both the other Sacraments) if either the Church had then us'd the Sacrament of Confirmation, or he look'd upon it as a Sacrament of the ſame general neceſſity with the other. Which things I have ſaid, not in the leaſt to detract from the uſe of Confirmation (for I think this very paſſage of <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> doth ſufficiently warrant the more material part of it, even prayer over the new Baptized perſon) but to ſhew that the Church did not then look upon it as a Sacrament, or, at leaſt, not as ſuch a one, as was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally neceſſary for Salvation, as our Catechiſm hath taught us to ſpeak.</p>
                     <p>But it may be much more may be ſaid for <hi>Abſolution,</hi> than <hi>Confirmation,</hi> and ſo no doubt there may, if we conſider Abſolution as comprehending within the compaſs of it the <hi>whole power of the Prieſt in remitting ſins.</hi> For comprehending within it, in that ſenſe, the Adminiſtration of Baptiſm, and the Lord's Supper, becauſe the moſt effectual means the Church hath for abſolving offenders from their guilt, ſo far as thoſe Sacraments, or the Prieſts Adminiſtration of them is neceſſary to Salvation (which no doubt they generally are) ſo far alſo his Abſolution muſt be look'd upon as ſuch. But ſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider Abſolution is to make it the ſame with Baptiſm, and the Lord's Supper, and not (as it is here propos'd) a diſtinct Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament from them. If therefore we will ſpeak pertinently either to our own <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> or the preſent Controverſie, we muſt conſider Abſolution as abſtracting from thoſe Sacraments; which if we do, we ſhall find it to conſiſt either in <hi>declaring the word of reconciliation to Offenders,</hi> or <hi>praying to God for their Pardon,</hi> or <hi>pronouncing them abſolved from their guilt, or looſing them from the Cenſures of the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If we conſider <hi>Abſolution</hi> in the firſt of theſe ſenſes, to wit as importing <hi>the declaration of the word of reconciliation to Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi> ſo we ſhall not ſtick to affirm, that it is generally neceſſary to Salvation, but then we muſt ſay withall, that it is no Sacrament, nor eſteemed by the Papiſts themſelves to be ſo.</p>

In the former of theſe regards it is no doubt as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, as it is for the Prieſt to celebrate, or the people to joyn with him in the publick worſhip of God, of which ſuch prayers as thoſe are a neceſſary part. But as there is no preſumption of that Offices being a Sacrament, ſo it is not the Abſolution our Adverſaries intend; That, which they profeſs to advance, being the Abſolution of <hi>particular</hi> perſons, after a confeſſion made by them of their particular offences. And yet even here too they make a diſtinction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe profeſſing to reſtrain that Confeſſion, and Abſolution to ſuch ſins only, as are mortal. But who taught them to diſtinguiſh in this affair between <hi>Mortal,</hi> and <hi>Venial?</hi> Or what is there in thoſe words of Chriſt, which convey the power of remitting ſins, which can be thought to reſtrain it to the former? What have they to ground the general neceſſity of ſuch a Confeſſion upon, but eſpecially as to that form of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, whereof we ſpeak? For in praying for the pardon of Offenders the Prieſt is not to be conſidered as a Judge, but as a perſon appointed to mediate between God, and his People, and whom that charity, which belongs to him as ſuch, will oblige him to look upon as penitent, if he knows them not to be otherwiſe, eſpecially if they beg his prayers for their own particular pardon. And indeed neither is this the Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution the Papiſts contend for, nay they declare<note n="(u)" place="margin">Conc. Trid. Seſſ. 14. cap. 3.</note> thoſe very Prayers, which go along with their own, not to be of the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of it. Which will oblige us to paſs on to</p>
                     <p>A <hi>third</hi> ſort of Abſolution, even <hi>pronouncing offending per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be looſed from their offences.</hi> A thing, which though of ſignal uſe, and comfort to men of afflicted minds, and which no doubt ſuch perſons ought to ſeek, when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwiſe ſatisfie themſelves, yet cannot be look'd upon as generally neceſſary to Salvation; Partly, becauſe none but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding perſons can be ſuppoſed to ſtand in need of it, and partly becauſe ſuch an Abſolution, as that, ſuppoſeth men to be already looſed from their offences, and conſequently not to want any thing, but the ſenſe thereof. Which though it may be an infelicity, yet is no ſin in it ſelf, nor can prove ſo to him, in whom it is, unleſs it do otherwiſe take him off from the due performance of his duty. Though, even in that caſe, ſuch an Abſolution will be neceſſary, rather to prevent future offences, than to procure the forgiveneſs of former ones. And I ſhall only add, that I conceive that form of Abſolution to be ſuch, which occurrs in our <hi>Viſitation of the Sick;</hi> Partly, becauſe it is ordered by our Church to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to men of troubled minds, and partly becauſe it prompts
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56517:36"/>the Prieſt to beg of God the forgiveneſs of the ſick perſons offences, before it allows him to ſay <hi>I abſolve thee from all thy ſins;</hi> That ſuppoſing the forgiveneſs of God to precede in this affair, and conſequently that the Prieſt rather declares the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon already abſolved, than abſolves him himſelf from the band of his offences.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> ſort of Abſolution is that, which <hi>looſeth men from the cenſures of the Church,</hi> and which I ſhall not ſtick to affirm to be generally neceſſary to the looſing of thoſe, who have been before bound, even from the band of their offences before God: Partly, becauſe God hath promis'd to bind that in Heaven, which the Governours of the Church ſhall right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully bind on Earth; And partly, becauſe the Cenſures of the Church conſiſting eſpecially in reſtraining men from its ſaving Offices, and particularly from the Sacrament of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, till men are looſed from thoſe Cenſures, they muſt be depriv'd of the ordinary means, whereby God hath appointed to tranſmit the pardon of offences. But as the queſtion is not, Whether Abſolution may be neceſſary in a particular caſe, or to particular perſons, but whether it be generally ſo; So we cannot look upon this Abſolution as generally neceſſary to Salvation, unleſs it were ſuch to fall under thoſe Cenſures, from which this Abſolution frees. The reſult of the Premiſes is this; The Church of God is indeed inveſted with a power of Abſolution, and ſuch, as exerts it ſelf in ſeveral Acts, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably to the needs of thoſe, with whom it hath to do: But as it is not inveſted with any ſuch power of Abſolution, as doth actually free the Offender from his guilt, the doing of that pertaining only unto God; As it is not therefore inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any other power of Abſolution, than what may ſerve to <hi>declare</hi> the pardon of God, or <hi>help toward the procuring</hi> of it; So what it doth toward either of theſe (unleſs it be in Baptiſm, or the Lord's Supper) is either no Sacrament at all, and ſo falls not under this enquiry, or is no generally neceſſary one. And indeed, however the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may ſeem to advance another Abſolution, even that which actually loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the ſinner from his guilt; Though ſhe moreover repreſent that Abſolution of her's, as generally neceſſary to the Salvation of thoſe who are under any mortal ſin; yet is there no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of any ſuch Abſolution, nor indeed of the neceſſity of any, but what is before deſcrib'd. As is evident, as to the <hi>former</hi> of theſe, from that very Text, on which it is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, even a promiſe of <hi>looſing that in Heaven, which ſhall be looſed on Earth.</hi> For if there muſt be a looſing in Heaven, after that on Earth, that on Earth cannot be look'd upon as actually freeing the Sinner from his guilt, but only as prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to it; With this only advantage (which might very well occaſion the ſo entitling it) that that looſing ſhall certainly be followed by a more effectual, and heavenly one. So little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is there to believe, that there is any Abſolution among
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56517:36"/>men, but what is purely preparatory to the Abſolution of God; And we ſhall find there is as little reaſon to ſeek out any other <hi>modes</hi> of it, than thoſe, which were before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd: As will appear if we conſider, who they are, that are to be looſed, and who as they are either ſuch, as are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Communion of the Church, or ſuch as are excluded from it, ſo, if they be of the former ſort, have either done nothing to deſerve an excluſion, or have committed ſuch offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as are worthy of it. If the perſons we ſpeak of be ſuch Members of the Church, as have not done any thing to deſerve an excluſion from it; So there cannot lye any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement upon them to confeſs their ſins to a Prieſt, or ſeek any other Abſolution, than by the Sacrament of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, or other the like ordinary methods of the Church: The Communion, in which they are, and which they have not done any thing to deprive themſelves of, giving them a title to that Sacrament, or any other priviledge of their Religion. But then if they be ſuch, as do really deſerve to be excluded, till they have given ſufficient teſtimonies of their repentance; Either they ought to be excluded, and afterwards looſed as Excommunicate perſons, or, if they be thought fit to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Church, be look'd upon as Members of it, and allowed the common Abſolutions of it: It being a kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction <hi>in adjecto</hi> to continue men in the Communion of the Church, and yet deny them the common priviledges there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. All therefore, that remains to be accounted for, is the Abſolution of thoſe, who have been ſhut out of the Church; But concerning which as there is no great difference between us, and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo we deny not but that it may require a peculiar <hi>form of words,</hi> and ſuch as may ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie to the perſons concern'd, and the Members of the Church the act of the Officers thereof in it. But that the Eſſence of Abſolution conſiſteth in it, doth not appear to us, nor can indeed be reaſonably affirm'd; Partly, becauſe the very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring Excommunicated perſons to the Communion of the Church will as effectually vacate its former Cenſures, as any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs declaration can do; And partly, becauſe Excommunication conſiſting in a deprivation from thoſe methods of Salvation, which God hath depoſited in the Church, the only effectual releaſe of it muſt lye in a re-admiſſion to them, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to the Sacrament of the Euchariſt. But ſo the Antient Church appears to have underſtood it, as is evident both from her language, and practice; She not only expreſſing this <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,</hi> by<note n="(w)" place="margin">See <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>'s Anſwer to the Jeſuites Challenge. <hi>pag.</hi> 132.</note> 
                        <hi>bringing men to the Communion, reconciling them to it,</hi> or <hi>reſtoring it to them,</hi> but taking care above all things, that no Excommunicated perſon generally ſhould go out of the World<note n="(x)" place="margin">Dionyſ. Alex. apud Euſeb. Eccl. Hiſt. li. 6. c. 44. item Conc. Nic. can. 13.</note> without partaking of the Euchariſt. For what other account can be given of that both language, and practice of hers, than that ſhe conceiv'd the Abſolution of Excommunicated perſons to lye in a re-admiſſion to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56517:37"/>methods of Salvation, and conſequently that they were rather loos'd by the uſe of thoſe methods, than by any judicial ſentence? This however is certain (which is enough for our preſent purpoſe) that Abſolution in this ſenſe cannot be look'd upon as generally neceſſary, becauſe the peculiar refuge of ſuch, as have been ſhut out of the Church. And if that be the caſe of Abſolution, as well as of the other ſuppoſed Sacraments; <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> will continue to be the <hi>only ones,</hi> that are of that <hi>neceſſity</hi> to Salvation.</p>

Thoſe myſteries every where initiated into by the Rite of <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> partly through Men's conſciouſneſs of their paſt ſins, and which they judged it but meet they ſhould be ſome way purged from, and partly through the policy of the Devil, who thereby thought to procure the greater venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them: That as it was a Rite, which was in uſe among God's own people, ſo naturally apt to repreſent to Mens minds their paſſing from a ſinful to a holy Eſtate.

                     <p>OF the ground of the preſent <hi>Digreſſion</hi> concerning <hi>Original Sin,</hi> and enquiry thereupon made, <hi>what</hi> Original Sin is.

That there is ſuch a thing, as we have before deſcribed, evidenced at large from the Scripture, and that evidence farther ſtrengthned by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience we have of its effects, and the acknowledgments of the wiſer Heathen. Enquiry next made from whence it had its beginning, which is ſhewn to have been not from any evil Spirit, or <hi>Daemon,</hi> the pravity of matter, or the evil habits the Soul contracted in a praeexiſtent ſtate, but from the pravity of our firſt Parents. This laſt at large confirm'd out of the Doctrine of the Scripture, and followed by ſome light reflections upon the means, by which it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed.

                     <p>For the underſtanding whereof we are to know, that as the Heathen themſelves were not without a preſenſion of another World, wherein the Souls of Men ſhould be treated according to their demeanour here; So they alike ſaw, or at leaſt ſuſpected, that they could not expect a happy <hi>futurity</hi> by a bare compliance with thoſe rules, which natural Religion ſuggeſted to them: Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe they ſaw but too well that they could never arrive at a perfect compliance with them, by which means they ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſtand in need of the divine favour, and forgiveneſs; And partly, becauſe they knew it to be in the power of their offended Deities to preſcribe what ways and means they thought good for Men's obtaining a reconciliation with them. This therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the general, and indeed natural ſenſe of Mankind, and not a little quickned at the firſt by what they might learn from God's own people concerning the Sacrifices, and other Rites, whereby he appointed them to atone him; Men began to look out every where for proper means to obtain the favour of their Gods; and the Devil, who was willing by all means to precipitate them into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, did either by himſelf, or his Agents ſuggeſt ſuch, as might gratifie thoſe their hopes, but withal not only no way profit them, but debauch their minds ſo much the more.

                     <p>How this way of initiation by Baptiſm came to prevail ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, is hard to ſay, and I will not therefore be over poſitive in defining. That, which ſeems to me to be the moſt probable, is, that thoſe myſteries, to which this way of initiation belonged,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56517:47"/>came all out of the ſame forge, even the contrivance of the Devil, and his dependants, to whom, though ignorantly, the Heathen offered<note n="(f)" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.20.</note> Sacrifice; That he ſuggeſted ſuch an initiation to them, partly in imitation of thoſe Baptiſms, or waſhings, which God had appointed among his own people, and partly as a <hi>Symbol,</hi> which did moſt naturally repreſent to their minds their paſſing from a ſinful to a holy Eſtate: Sin, by reaſon of the odiouſneſs thereof, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have both the eſteem, and name of <hi>Pollution,</hi> and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which profeſſed to do it away, beſt repreſented by that Element, which was moſt proper to purge away the natural one; In fine, that they, to whom that form of initiation was propos'd, being thereby poſſeſs'd with a good opinion of the ſacredneſs of thoſe myſteries, to which it led, and a hope of its alſo purging them from their former guilt, greedily embraced it, and made it as ſacred in their own eſteem, as it ſeemed to be in the deſign of thoſe, that inſtituted it. Which moreover they were more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſuaded into, becauſe they found it much more eaſie thus to waſh away their Sins, than to purge their Conſcience<note n="(g)" place="margin">Heb. 9.14.</note> from dead works by repentance, and amendment. By theſe degrees, I ſuppoſe, it was, that Baptiſm came, even among the Heathen; to be the general form of initiating them into their reſpective myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; And had thoſe myſteries been as ſacred, as their initiation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them was ſpecious, it might have ſerv'd to them for a perpetual monument of that inward, and far better purity, which it becomes all thoſe to put on, who hope for approbation from the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.

For all theſe particulars have been obſerv'd concerning that Baptiſm whereof we ſpeak, and the Baptiſm it ſelf not only made as antient as <hi>Moſes,</hi> but deduced by them from that command of God<note n="(m)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.10.</note>, whereby <hi>Moſes</hi> was enjoyn'd to ſanctifie the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and cauſe them to waſh their Cloaths, againſt the time that God declar'd from Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> that legal Covenant, which they were then to enter into.</p>
                     <p>Whether the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers might not ſomewhat overlaſh in making their Baptiſm ſo very ancient, or err in aſſigning the former Command as the Original thereof, is a thing I mean not to diſpute, and much leſs will I concern my ſelf ſo far in it, as to vindicate them againſt all oppoſers. But as it is hard to believe, they would attribute ſo great an antiquity to that, which was not at leaſt ſomewhat antienter than our Saviour's time, which is all we are concerned to aſſert; So it will be much more hard to detract altogether from their teſtimony, if it hath any concurring proofs, and be otherwiſe fairly defenſible againſt the adverſaries thereof. Now that the teſtimony of the Jewiſh Writers is not without ſome concurring proofs, and ſuch as will at leaſt add to the probability thereof, will appear if we conſider <hi>firſt,</hi> that though Circumciſion both was, and was intended as a means of initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet it was ſuch a form of initiation, as was competible only to the <hi>Males.</hi> By which means, if there had been no other form of initiation, all of the <hi>Female</hi> Sex, who were undoubtedly as much in Covenant with God, as thoſe of the other, muſt have
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56517:48"/>been debar'd of any viſible Sacrament to aſſure them of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in it. Which though it be not ſo great an inconvenience, as to enforce altogether the uſe of ſomewhat beſide Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe the Females might be initiated in their Fathers, yet will make it reaſonable enough to believe, that God, with whom there is no reſpect of Sexes, appointed ſome form of initiation, by which they might be alike admitted. I ſay <hi>Secondly,</hi> that as Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was not competible to thoſe of the Female Sex, and not unlikely therefore that there might be ſome other ceremony for their initiation; So it is apparent from S. <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <note n="(n)" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.2.</note>, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God might deal with the <hi>Jews</hi> before, or after, yet all of them, in their paſſage from <hi>Aegypt</hi> unto <hi>Canaan,</hi> were <hi>baptized into Moſes in the Cloud, and in the Sea.</hi> For being ſo, it is not difficult to believe, that the ſame form of initiation might afterwards have force in thoſe, who were not capable of Circumciſion, yea even in them, that were capable of it, after the Rite of Circumciſion was over, if it were only to put them in mind, of that delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance they receiv'd by it: Eſpecially, when their Euchariſtical Manna, though thence forward not enjoyn'd to be us'd, becauſe it ceaſed from among them, was yet laid up in the Ark of God<note n="(o)" place="margin">Exod. 16.32, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> to put them in mind of God's nouriſhing them by it. I ſay <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that though Baptiſm might not be enjoyned at the firſt, or at leaſt enjoyn'd only for the uſe of thoſe, who were not capable of Circumciſion, yet it might by the advice of their Governors, and the approbation of thoſe Prophets whom God raiſed up among them, be afterwards added to Circumciſion, both upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Fore-fathers being commanded to ſanctifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and waſh their Cloaths when they appear'd before God at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and as a farther declaration to them of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity of their Nature, and of that pure, and holy eſtate, which they entred into. For if their Fore-fathers were, even by the command of God, to ſanctifie themſelves with waſhings toward their entring into Covenant with God at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> what ſhould hinder ſuch of their poſterity, as preſided over that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to make an addition of the like Baptiſm? Eſpecially, when all was little enough to admoniſh them of their own natural im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity, and of the neceſſity that lay upon them of purging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from it. I obſerve <hi>Fourthly,</hi> that though there be not any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs mention in the Scripture of that Baptiſm whereof we ſpeak, nor indeed of any like it beſide that of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, which being immediately <hi>from Heaven</hi> ought not to be drawn into example; yet is it ſufficiently intimated by our Saviour, where, upon <hi>Nicodemus</hi>'s wondring how a Man could be born of Water, and the Spirit, he with equal wonder demanded<note n="(p)" place="margin">Joh. 3.10.</note>, <hi>Art thou a Maſter of Iſrael, and knoweſt not theſe things?</hi> For as that is a ſufficient indication, that the notion our Saviour advanc'd was no ſtranger to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and therefore neither ſuch a Baptiſm, as was the ſubject of it; So it became yet more clear by the Jewiſh Writers repreſenting the Baptiſm of a Proſelyte as giving a new birth unto him: That as it is the ſame in effect with the product of Chriſt's Baptiſm, ſo making it yet more reaſonable to believe, that our Saviour had an eye to it, when he wondred ſo much at <hi>Nicodemus</hi> for ſtumbling
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56517:48"/>at that property in his. All which put together, becauſe tending toward the ſame thing, will make it yet more reaſonable to believe, that the Jewiſh Writers ſpake not at adventure, when they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Rite of Baptiſm as a Rite of their own Nation, and by which both themſelves, and their Proſelytes had been of old initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, no leſs than by the Rite of Circumciſion. If there be any thing to hinder the admiſſion of it, it muſt be the ſilence of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> concerning it, or at leaſt concerning the Inſtitution of it. But as we find no great mention, even of Circumciſion it ſelf after the five Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and may therefore the leſs wonder at the no mention of Baptiſm, eſpecially if, as it might be, inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, after his time; As we find as little mention, even where it might have been more reaſonably expected, of the firſt <hi>Jews</hi> being <hi>bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into Moſes in the Cloud, and in the Sea,</hi> or of their <hi>Eating,</hi> and <hi>Drinking</hi> that <hi>ſpiritual</hi> repaſt, whereof S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh<note n="(q)" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.3, 4.</note>: So there is as little reaſon therefore to wonder at its ſilence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Rite, eſpecially conſidering, what is notorious enough from thence, that God from time to time rais'd up Prophets among them. For their Authority, and Preaching might ſuffice to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute, or confirm a matter of greater moment, than the Rite of Baptiſm, as added to Circumciſion, can be ſuppoſed to have been.</p>
                     <p>There being therefore no great doubt to be made of a Baptiſm among the <hi>Jews</hi> antecedent to that of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and our Saviour, it will not be difficult to believe <hi>firſt,</hi> that our Saviour had an eye to it, when he appointed the ſame Rite to initiate Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Religion: Partly becauſe it was his avowed Profeſſion, that he came rather to reform, than deſtroy their former Oeconomy; and partly becauſe he might the more reaſonably hope to bring them over to that faith, which it was an initiation into. It will be as eaſie to believe, <hi>Secondly,</hi> upon the ſcore of the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion, and compliance, that Chriſt departed as little as might be from their manner of Adminiſtration of it, or from the ends, which it was appointed for among them; ſuch a compliance being equally neceſſary to carry on his deſign of bringing them over to his Religion. The conſequence whereof will be <hi>thirdly,</hi> that where it doth not very plainly appear that Chriſtianity hath made an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in it, we interpret the Baptiſm thereof conformably to that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> from whence it appears to have been tranſcrib'd. How much more then, where there are any fair hints in Chriſtianity of its ſymbolizing with the Doctrine of the other? The reſult of which will be <hi>fourthly,</hi> our having recourſe upon occaſion to the Baptiſm of the <hi>Jews</hi> for the better clearing, or eſtabliſhing the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of our own. Which as I ſhall therefore not fail to do as often as their Writings ſhall furniſh matter for it; ſo having ſaid thus much concerning their Baptiſm, and that of the Heathen, I will paſs on to the Baptiſm of the Chriſtians, and confine my ſelf yet more ſtrictly to the conſideration of it.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OW the firſt thing to be enquired after is the Inſtitution of it, and ſo much the rather, becauſe though there is no doubt as to the thing it ſelf, yet there is as to the firſt beginning of it. For there are, who have thought this Sacrament to have been firſt inſtituted by our Saviour imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before his Aſcenſion, and when he gave command to his Diſciples<note n="*" place="margin">Matt. 28.19.</note> to <hi>go, and teach,</hi> or diſciple <hi>all Nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the

                        <hi>to the loſt ſheep of the Houſe of Iſrael</hi>) that that was the firſt inſtitution of it, as to that more <hi>general extent</hi> it was to have in the World, and it may be too as to that clear, and explicit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Trinity, into the Names of which our Saviour after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards commanded to baptize: Becauſe ſuch Doctrines as that were to be poured into the Diſciples by degrees, and according as they ſhould be able to receive them. But that the Sacrament it ſelf had a more early Inſtitution, will appear from the mention there is of our Saviour's baptizing long before, or at leaſt of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples doing it by his Commiſſion, and Appointment.</p>
                     <p>For the clearing whereof we are to know, that whatſoever he may be thought to have done, before he firſt paſſed into <hi>Judaea</hi> after his own Baptiſm by <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, yet <hi>there</hi> he<note n="†" place="margin">Joh. 3.22.</note>, or his <hi>Diſciples</hi>

Which makes me wonder ſo much the more, that <hi>Tertullian</hi>
                        <note n="(g)" place="margin">De Bapt. c. <hi>11.</hi>
                        </note> ſhould make that Baptiſm of the Diſciples but of the ſame nature with that of <hi>John,</hi> but above all at his asking, how <hi>Chriſt could be ſuppoſed to baptize into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when</hi> he at that <hi>time made it his buſineſs to conceal who, and what he was.</hi> For as <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt was not wanting<note n="(h)" place="margin">Joh. 1.29, &amp;c.</note> to diſcover what he was; ſo our Saviour was ſo far from being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd as to that particular, that the very firſt of thoſe Diſciples, that came to him, did both acknowledge him<note n="(i)" place="margin">Joh. 41.45.</note> as the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> immediately, and repreſent him as ſuch to other Men.</p>
                     <p>But let us riſe yet higher, than Chriſt's baptizing in <hi>Judaea,</hi> though that be not far remov'd from his firſt ſetting up for Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, becauſe whilſt <hi>John</hi> was yet<note n="†" place="margin">Joh. 3.22, 23.</note> baptizing, which is the time, from whence the Scripture<note n="(k)" place="margin">Act. 1.22. — 10.37.</note> makes our Saviour's preaching to commence. Not that there are any expreſs proofs before that time of his baptizing any Diſciples, but that it may be ſome probable proofs may offer themſelves for it, and ſuch as we cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably refuſe. Of which nature I reckon firſt his making Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples before that time, and particularly thoſe Diſciples, whom he made uſe of to baptize in the Land of <hi>Jury.</hi> For if our Saviour made Diſciples before, why not after the ſame manner, wherein he made thoſe of <hi>Judaea?</hi> He had to induce him to it the cuſtom, that then prevail'd among the <hi>Jews,</hi> of making Diſciples by that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56517:50"/>ſolemnity, as appears both by their ſo admitting Proſelytes, and the Baptiſm of his Forerunner. He had to induce him to it the greater likelihood there was thereby of inviting others to the ſame Baptiſm, than if thoſe, who were the firſt, and chief, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over made uſe of by himſelf to baptize, had not firſt been baptiz'd themſelves: Becauſe ſo there could have been no pretence to refuſe the Baptiſm he propos'd, whereas otherwiſe they might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected it as a thing unneceſſary to be had, or ſcrupled it as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from incompetent Adminiſtrators of it. In fine, he had to induce him to it that, which prevail'd with himſelf<note n="(l)" place="margin">Matt. 3.15.</note> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> even their <hi>fulfilling all righteouſneſs,</hi> who were not only the firſt of his Diſciples, but ordained by himſelf to be a pattern unto others. Which inducements as they are of no ſmall force to perſuade his baptizing from the beginning, becauſe but ſuitable to his own proceedings, or the common reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Mankind; ſo will no doubt be accounted ſuch, if there be not equal probabilities to the contrary, as which are the only things, that can take off the edge of them. Now what is there of that nature, that can perſwade Chriſt's omiſſion of Baptiſm, unleſs it be either the Scripture's ſilence, which ſhall be afterwards conſidered, or his willingneſs thereby to intimate, that he had not ſo tied his own Graces to an external Rite, but that he could, and would upon occaſion conferr them without it? But beſide that there was a like fear thereby of Men's neglecting his appointments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a preſumption of their receiving his Graces as the Apoſtles did; This may ſeem to have been too early a ſeaſon for ſuch an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, becauſe before Men were well confirm'd in his Authority, or ability to conferr them, even by the ordinary ſolemnities. For if they were not as yet well confirm'd in that, how ſhould they dream of a greater power, yea not rather be thereby tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to queſtion altogether his Authority, becauſe departing ſo far even from the example of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> whom all Men<note n="(m)" place="margin">Matt. 21.26.</note> 
                        <hi>accounted as a Prophet?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But beſide that our Saviour made Diſciples before, and may therefore not improbably be thought to have made them after the ſame manner; We find yet farther, that before he baptiz'd thoſe of <hi>Judaea,</hi> he repreſented the ſolemnity of Baptiſm as a thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to enter Men into that Kingdom of God, to which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited them: Our Saviour not only telling <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> that <hi>except a Man were born again</hi>
                        <note n="(n)" place="margin">Joh. 3.3.</note>, <hi>he could not ſee the Kingdom of God,</hi> but yet more plainly, that <hi>except he were born again of Water</hi>
                        <note n="(o)" place="margin">Joh. 3.5.</note>, <hi>and of the Spirit, he could not poſſibly enter into it.</hi> For how could Chriſt repreſent that as neceſſary, which he himſelf had not afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his firſt, and chiefeſt Diſciples, nor, for ought that doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, ever after did? For if he did, he would certainly have done it before he made uſe of them to baptize others; Partly becauſe they were the firſt Diſciples he had, and partly becauſe ſo they would have been more apparently qualified to have adminiſtred the ſame Baptiſm unto others. If therefore Chriſt repreſented Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm as neceſſary, even before his baptizing in <hi>Judaea,</hi> it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable to think he had both inſtituted, and adminiſtred it before: Eſpecially, when the Diſciples he before had cannot well
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56517:51"/>be thought to have had it afterwards, as in reaſon they muſt have had it, if it were ſo neceſſary as our Saviour affirm'd it. And poſſibly neither would they, who are otherwiſe perſwaded, have in the leaſt ſuſpected the force of this argument, had it not been for an opinion of theirs, that our Saviour ſpake not in this place of Baptiſm, but of Men's being born again of that ſpirit of God, which hath the ſame cleanſing quality with water: So ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that ſpeech of our Saviour to be that, which the <hi>Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> call an <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and conſequently reſolvable into a <hi>watery,</hi> or <hi>cleanſing Spirit,</hi> as Virgil<hi>'s pateris libamus &amp; auro,</hi> is into <hi>pate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris aureis,</hi> or <hi>golden Diſhes.</hi> Even as they ſuppoſe the Scripture<note n="(p)" place="margin">Matt. 3.11.</note> meant when it affirm'd, that Chriſt ſhould baptize <hi>with the Holy Ghoſt, and with fire,</hi> that is to ſay, with that Holy Ghoſt, which hath the <hi>purifying,</hi> and <hi>warming</hi> qualities of that Element. I will not now ſay, though I might, that that <hi>figure</hi> might have been more allowable here, if that ſpeech of Chriſt could have been ſo fairly reſolv'd into a <hi>watery Spirit,</hi> as <hi>pateris &amp; auro</hi> may be into <hi>pateris aureis;</hi> Which that it cannot be, is ſufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from Gold's being the proper Material of thoſe Diſhes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Poet ſpeaks, which <hi>water</hi> to be ſure is not of the other. But neither will I any more than ſay, that Chriſt's baptizing <hi>with the Holy Ghoſt, and with fire</hi> doth not make at all for this <hi>figure,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is certain that at the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> which was the moſt notorious deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt, and particularly referr'd to by that Baptiſm<note n="(q)" place="margin">Act. 1.5.</note>, Chriſt baptized his Diſciples with a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial fire, as well as that. But I ſay, which is more material, that there is great reaſon to underſtand our Saviour <hi>here</hi> of <hi>that Baptiſm</hi> by water, which we have affirmed his words to import. For ſo firſt (as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>
                        <note n="(r)" place="margin">Eccl. Pol. li. 5. §. 59.</note> did long ſince obſerve) the Letter of the Text perſwades, and which we are not lightly to depart from, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we will make the Scripture a very uncertain Rule, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to prove any thing, which wanton wits would have it. So ſecondly (as the ſame <hi>Hooker</hi>
                        <note n="(ſ)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> obſerves) the <hi>Antients</hi>

                        </note> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception underſtood it, yea he<note n="†" place="margin">Tertul. ubi ſupra.</note>, who makes the Baptiſm now under conſideration, even the Baptiſm of Chriſt before his Aſcenſion, to be but of the ſame nature with S. <hi>John</hi>'s. So third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we have cauſe to underſtand Chriſt here, becauſe expreſſing what he here intended by a <hi>new birth from water,</hi> which is the property<note n="(t)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5.</note> of that Baptiſm, he afterwards commanded the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to adminiſter. In fine, ſo ſeveral circumſtances both of the Text, and Context perſwade, and ſome too, that are not ſo ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily taken notice of. Of which nature I reckon as none of the leaſt that, which gave occaſion to them, even <hi>Nicodemus</hi>'s <hi>coming to Jeſus by night</hi>
                        <note n="(u)" place="margin">Joh. 3.2.</note>, and there, and then acknowledging to him, that he was a <hi>teacher come from God,</hi> and that he himſelf was induced to believe it by the <hi>miracles</hi> our Saviour wrought. For that <hi>ſecret</hi> confeſſion of his being not only not agreeable to that more publick one<note n="(w)" place="margin">Matt. 10.32.</note>, which our Saviour requir'd, but (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the anſwer he return'd to it) intimated by him to be inſufficient, becauſe letting him know, that <hi>except he was born again of water, and the ſpirit,</hi> he could not enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God; Nothing can be more agreeable to our Saviour's
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56517:51"/>mind, than to underſtand thoſe <hi>Words</hi> of his of Men's making a more publick confeſſion of him in order to their Salvation, if the <hi>Words</hi> can with any reaſon be thought to admit of it. Which that they may is evident from hence, that, whatever our Saviour now underſtood by them, the like expreſſion<note n="(x)" place="margin">Tit. 3.5.</note> became afterwards an uſual <hi>periphraſis</hi> of Baptiſm, which was a publick confeſſion of our Saviour. I ſay ſecondly, that as the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the words doth naturally lead to ſuch a ſenſe, as will make them import a more publick Confeſſion of our Saviour; So it will conſequently prompt us to underſtand them of ſuch a new Birth, as is perform'd by Water, and the Spirit, rather than of that, which is perform'd by the Spirit alone: That, as it is a Birth, which manifeſts it ſelf to the Eyes of others, which this cannot be ſuppoſed to do, ſo being a Birth therefore, which may publickly declare our Confeſſion of him, by whoſe appointment we are born again. Agreeable hereto thirdly, is the ſenſe of the words themſelves, if thoſe <hi>Jews,</hi> of whom <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> was ſometime a Ruler, may be liſtned to in this affair; They not only affirming their own Proſelytes to have been admitted by Baptiſm, but that Baptiſm alſo repreſented as a thing, which gave them a new birth, yea ſo far, as to make them put off their old relations by it. For what then can be more reaſonable, than to think, that our Saviour, when he ſpake to a <hi>Jew,</hi> ſpake the ſame Language with them, and conſequently, that, as he ſpake of being born of Water, as well as the Spirit, he meant a like Baptiſm by it. Eſpecially, when it is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, fourthly, that our Saviour ask'd <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> not without ſome amazement,<note n="(y)" place="margin">Joh. 3.10.</note>, <hi>Art thou a Maſter in Iſrael, and knoweſt not theſe things?</hi> For what was this, but to intimate yet more, that the new Birth, whereof he ſpake, was no ſtranger to themſelves, and conſequently, becauſe he ſpake of being born of Water, that he meant a Baptiſm by it? Add hereunto, fifthly; our Saviour's affirming himſelf in the former Diſcourſe to have ſpoken of <hi>earthly</hi>
                        <note n="(z)" place="margin">Joh. 3.12.</note> things, and (as one would think) therefore of ſuch a Birth, which though influenced by God's Spirit, yet had ſomething of earthly, as that is oppos'd to heavenly, adhering to it: As, in fine, the Evangeliſt's ſubjoyning to this Diſcourſe of a <hi>new Birth by Water</hi> the mention of our Saviour's<note n="(*)" place="margin">Joh. 3.22.</note> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing into <hi>Judaea,</hi> and <hi>there baptizing;</hi> There being not a fairer account either of that connexion, or our Saviour's proceedings, than that, agreeably to what he had ſaid concerning the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Men's being <hi>ſo born again,</hi> he went into <hi>Judaea,</hi> and <hi>baptized,</hi> and ſo made way for their <hi>entrance into God</hi>'s <hi>Kingdom.</hi> Such evidence there is of our Saviour's meaning a proper Baptiſm, when he ſpake of the neceſſity of Men's being <hi>born again of water, and of the Spirit;</hi> And if our Saviour meant ſuch a Baptiſm, there is as little doubt of his having before both inſtituted, and adminiſtred it, yea even from the time of his ſetting up for Diſciples; There being not the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Chriſt's baptizing thoſe firſt Diſciples afterwards, which yet he muſt have done, conſidering the neceſſity thereof, if they had not been baptiz'd before.</p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:56517:52"/>
                     <p>I will conclude what I have to ſay concerning the earlineſs of our Saviour's Baptiſm, when I have added from a paſſage of Chriſt to S. <hi>Peter</hi> the farther probability there is of <hi>his,</hi> and the <hi>other Apoſtles</hi> having receiv'd it, and therefore, if they did ſo, of their having receiv'd it from the beginning of their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipleſhip: That I mean, whereupon S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s begging of Chriſt to <hi>waſh not only his feet, but his hands, and his head,</hi> if (as our Saviour had told him) <hi>he could have no part in him, unleſs he waſh'd him,</hi> Chriſt is ſaid to have made anſwer<note n="†" place="margin">Joh. 13.10.</note>, that <hi>he, that had been waſh'd,</hi> even by a more general waſhing, <hi>needed not ſave to waſh his feet.</hi> For as our Saviour intimates by that expreſſion, that he, and the reſt had paſſed under the former waſhing, and conſequently did not need ſuch a general waſhing a ſecond time; ſo he may not improbably be thought to have meant the waſhing of Baptiſm, and which though in it ſelf an outward purification, yet was attended with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ſpiritua lone: Partly, becauſe it is certain that our Saviour had before this time madeuſe of the Baptiſm of Water to purifie Men unto himſelf, and may therefore be well enough ſuppoſed to allude unto it; And partly, becauſe that Baptiſm, or waſhing will be more directly oppoſed to that, which our Saviour now intended, and which though deſign'd by him to ſignifie a more ſpiritual purgation, even that of the affections, or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet was performed by him by an outward waſhing. For why then ſhould we not think, that the Apoſtles had that more general waſhing of Baptiſm? Eſpecially when we know that about this time Chriſt adminiſtred to them the Sacrament of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, and which as it is in order of nature after that of Baptiſm, and may therefore not unreaſonably be thought to have been preceded by theirs, ſo is an evidence that Chriſt meant, in ſome meaſure at leaſt, to conduct them by the ſame Rites, and Ceremonies, wherewith he intended to bring other Men unto himſelf.</p>
                     <p>One only thing there is, which can any way prejudice the former Diſcourſe, even the <hi>ſilence</hi> there is in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> of any Baptiſm by Chriſt before that in <hi>Judaea,</hi> yea the ſilence there is of it in that very <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> who takes ſuch particular notice of the other. And ſurely ſuch a ſilence would have been of no ſmall force, if it had been either a perfect ſilence, or an unaccountable one. But as that ſtory cannot be look'd upon as perfectly ſilent, which affords ſo many probable proofs of what it is pretended to be ſilent in; ſo there may be reaſon enough given of its aſcending no higher in its account of Chriſt's admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Baptiſm, than that, which was performed by him in <hi>Judaea:</hi> Partly, becauſe the <hi>Author</hi> of it had before acquainted his Readers with Chriſt's repreſenting it as generally neceſſary<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 3.5.</note> to Salvation, and from which, and the following practice of our Saviour in making Diſciples, Men might reaſonably enough collect his having ſo made the former ones; And partly, becauſe he knew, that what was defective in his account of our Saviour's Baptiſm, might be abundantly ſupplied to poſterity (to whom he, and the other Evangeliſts principally wrote) by what thoſe other Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts

                     <p>Now there are four things to be enquir'd concerning the firſt of theſe, even the outward and viſible ſign of Baptiſm. Firſt, what that outward and viſible ſign is. Secondly, wherein it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as a ſign. Thirdly, how it ought to be applied. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what is to be thought of thoſe additions, which were ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made, or continue as yet in being in the outward ſolemnities of Baptiſm.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As touching the outward, and viſible ſign of Baptiſm, there is no doubt it is the Element of Water, as is evident from the native ſignification of the word <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> which ſignifies an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion,</hi> or <hi>dipping into ſome liquid thing,</hi> from the matter of thoſe Baptiſms, which were in uſe among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and which our Saviour (becauſe making uſe of the ſame <hi>word</hi> to expreſs his own Baptiſm by) is in reaſon to be ſuppos'd to have ſo far conform'd it to, but more eſpecially from the account we have of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of it, both whilſt our Saviour continu'd here, and after his Aſcenſion into Heaven. For thus after S. <hi>John</hi> had ſaid<note n="†" place="margin">Joh. 3.22.</note>, that our Saviour, preſently after his entring upon his Prophetick Office, came into the Land of <hi>Judaea,</hi> and there baptized, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſubjoyn'd<note n="†" place="margin">Joh. 3.23.</note>, that <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt <hi>alſo was then bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing in Aenon near to Salim, becauſe there was much water there.</hi> For as it is evident from thence, as well as from other places<note n="*" place="margin">Matt. 3.6. —13.</note>, that the Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> was a Baptiſm by Water; ſo the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt mentioning <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt as practiſing the ſame thing with our Saviour, ſhews the Baptiſm of our Saviour to have been ſo far like it, and conſequently to have had Water for the Inſtrument thereof. The ſame is yet more evident as to the practice of our Saviour's Diſciples, after his more general Command<note n="(a)" place="margin">Matt. 28.19.</note> of Baptiſm, and his own Aſcenſion into Heaven. For thus we find <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch going down into a certain water</hi>
                        <note n="(b)" place="margin">Act. 8.38.</note>, by which they paſs'd in order to the Baptiſm of the latter; As that too, after the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch</hi> had admoniſhed him<note n="(c)" place="margin">Act. 8.36.</note>, <hi>See here is water, what doth hinder me to be baptized?</hi> And thus too we find S. <hi>Peter</hi>
                        <note n="(d)" place="margin">Act. 10.47, 48.</note>, before he gave order for <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and his companies being <hi>baptized in the name of the Lord,</hi> demanding of thoſe of the <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> that came with him, whether <hi>any Man could forbid water, that theſe ſhould not be baptized, which had receiv'd the Holy Ghoſt, as well as themſelves;</hi> Thereby intimating, or rather expreſly declaring, that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Baptiſm was, as to the outward, and viſible ſign, the ſame with that of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and other the Baptiſms of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:56517:54"/>
                     <p n="2">2. Water therefore being no doubt the outward and viſible ſign of Baptiſm, and ſo declared to be by the manner of its Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration; The next thing to be enquir'd into is, wherein it was intended as a ſign, which will appear to have been in theſe three particulars: Firſt in reſpect of that cleanſing quality, which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to it, ſecondly in reſpect of that uſe which it was put to about new-born Infants, thirdly in reſpect of that manner of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it, which was firſt us'd, and no doubt generally intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I mean the dipping of the Party baptized in it.</p>
                     <p>That the Water of Baptiſm was intended as a ſign in reſpect of the firſt of theſe, will need no other proof, than <hi>Ananias</hi>'s ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>ariſe and be baptized, and waſh</hi>

                        <hi>away his ſins,</hi> calling upon the name of the Lord. For it appearing, on the one hand, that the Baptiſm, to which <hi>Paul</hi> was invited, even the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian one, was a Baptiſm by Water, and, on the other hand, that it was at leaſt ordained for the <hi>remiſſion</hi>
                        <note n="(f)" place="margin">Act. 2.38.</note> 
                        <hi>of ſins,</hi> and ſo the putting away their guilt; Nothing can be more reaſonable, than to think, that when <hi>Ananias</hi> ſubjoyn'd to the precept of <hi>being bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd</hi> that of <hi>waſhing away his ſins,</hi> he meant his waſhing them away by Baptiſm, and conſequently that the Water of Baptiſm was both a ſign of ſomething relating to the putting away of his ſins, and a ſign too in particular in reſpect of that cleanſing quality, which is natural to it, becauſe that Baptiſm, to which it belongs, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd as <hi>waſhing</hi> away the other.</p>
                     <p>But beſide that Water was intended as a ſign in reſpect of that cleanſing quality, which is natural to it; There is equal reaſon to believe, that it was alſo intended as ſuch in reſpect of the uſe it was then put to about <hi>new-born Infants,</hi> even the waſhing away of thoſe impurities, which they contracted from the Womb.

                        </note>. For this evidently ſhews this <hi>ſecond</hi> Birth to relate to the <hi>firſt,</hi> and conſequently, that the Element of Water, and the Regeneration by it, though bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed more immediately from the Baptiſm of the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet was intended by our Saviour (as I no way doubt it was alſo by the <hi>Jews</hi>) as of like uſe with that, which was apply'd to new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Infants, and to repreſent alike waſhing away of natural pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions.</p>
                     <p>One other particular there is, wherein I have ſaid the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Baptiſm to have been intended as a ſign, and that is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of that <hi>manner</hi> of application, which was ſometime us'd, I mean the <hi>dipping,</hi> or <hi>plunging</hi> the party baptized in it. A ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> will not ſuffer thoſe to forget, who have been acquainted with his Epiſtles. For with reference to that manner of Baptizing we find him affirming<note n="(m)" place="margin">Rom. 6.4.</note>, that we are <hi>buried with Chriſt by Baptiſm into death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead, by the glory of the Father, even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of life;</hi> And again<note n="(n)" place="margin">Rom. 6.5.</note>, that <hi>if we have been plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together in the likeneſs of his death, we ſhall be alſo in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his reſurrection.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe, or rather yet more clearly, doth that Apoſtle diſcourſe, where he tells us<note n="(o)" place="margin">Col. 2.12.</note>, that as we are <hi>buried with Chriſt in Baptiſm, ſo we do therein riſe alſo with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raiſed him from the Dead.</hi> For what is this but to ſay, that as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Baptiſm was to oblige Men to conform ſo far to Chriſt's Death, and Reſurrection, as to die unto Sin, and live again unto Righteouſneſs, ſo it was perform'd by the ceremony of immerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the perſon immers'd might by that very ceremony, which was no obſcure image of a Sepulture, be minded of the precedent death, as in like manner, by his coming again out of the Water, of his riſing from that death to life, after the example of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituter thereof? For which cauſe, as hath been elſewhere<note n="(p)" place="margin">Expl. of the Creed, in the words, <hi>And Buried.</hi>
                        </note> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, the Antient Church added to the Rite of immerſion the dipping of the party three ſeveral times to repreſent the three days Chriſt continued in the Grave (for that we find to have been the intention of ſome) and made the <hi>Eve</hi> of <hi>Eaſter</hi> one of the ſolemn times of the Adminiſtration of it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third thing to be enquir'd concerning the outward viſible ſign of Baptiſm is, how it ought to be apply'd, where again theſe two things would be conſidered. Firſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ought to be applyed by an immerſion, or by that, or an aſperſion, or effuſion. Secondly, whether it ought to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by a threefold immerſion, or aſperſion, anſwerably to the names into which we are baptiz'd, or either by that, or a ſingle one.</p>
                     <p>The former of theſe is, it may be, a more material queſtion, than it is commonly deem'd by us, who have been accuſtomed to baptize by a bare effuſion, or ſprinkling of water upon the party. For in things, which depend for their force, upon the meer will, and pleaſure of him, who inſtituted them, there ought, no doubt,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56517:55"/>great regard to be had to the commands of him, who did ſo; As without which there is no reaſon to preſume, we ſhall receive the benefit of that ceremony, to which he hath been pleaſed to annex it. Now, what the command of Chriſt was in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, cannot well be doubted of by thoſe who ſhall conſider firſt the words of Chriſt<note n="(q)" place="margin">Matt. 28.19.</note> concerning it, and the practice of thoſe times, whether in the Baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> or of <hi>our Saviour.</hi> For the words of Chriſt are, that they ſhould <hi>Baptize,</hi> or <hi>Dip</hi> thoſe, whom they made Diſciples to him (for ſo, no doubt, the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> properly ſignifies) and, which is more, and not without its weight, that they ſhould baptize them <hi>into</hi> the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt: Thereby inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating ſuch a waſhing, as ſhould receive the party baptized with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the very body of that Water, which they were to baptize him with. Though, if there could be any doubt concerning the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the words in themſelves, yet would that doubt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd by conſidering the practice of thoſe times, whether in the Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> or of our Saviour. For ſuch as was the practice of thoſe times in Baptizing, ſuch in reaſon are we to think our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's command to have been concerning it, eſpecially, when the words themſelves incline that way; There being not otherwiſe any means either for thoſe, or future times to diſcover his intention concerning it. Now what the practice of thoſe times was as to this particular, will need no other proof than their reſorting to <hi>Rivers,</hi> and other ſuch like <hi>receptacles</hi> of waters for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of that ceremony, as that too becauſe there was <hi>much Water</hi> there. For ſo the Scripture doth not only affirm concerning the Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi>
                        <note n="(r)" place="margin">Matt. 3.5.6.13. John 3.23.</note>, but both intimate concerning that, which our Saviour adminiſtred in <hi>Judaea</hi> (becauſe making <hi>John</hi>'s Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and <hi>his</hi> to be ſo far forth of the ſame ſort<note n="(ſ)" place="margin">Joh. 3.22, 23.</note>) and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm concerning the Baptiſm of the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> which is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſtian Baptiſm the Scripture is any thing particular in the deſcription of: The words of S. <hi>Luke</hi>
                        <note n="(t)" place="margin">Act. 8.38.</note> being, that both <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch</hi> went down into a certain water which they met with in their journey, in order to the baptizing of the latter. For what need would there have been either of the Baptiſt's reſorting to great confluxes of Water, or of <hi>Philip,</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch</hi>'s go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down into this, were it not that the Baptiſm both of the one, and the other was to be performed by an immerſion? A very little Water, as we know it doth with us, ſufficing for an effuſion, or ſprinkling. But beſide the words of our Bleſſed Saviour, and the concurrent practice of thoſe times, wherein this Sacrament was inſtituted; It is in my opinion of no leſs conſideration, that the thing ſignified by the Sacrament of Baptiſm, cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be well repreſented, than by an immerſion, or at leaſt by ſome more general way of purification, than that of effuſion, or ſprinkling. For though the pouring, or ſprinkling of a little Water upon the Face may ſuffice to repreſent an internal waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which ſeems to be the general end of Chriſt's making uſe of the Sacrament of Baptiſm; yet can it not be thought to repreſent ſuch an <hi>entire</hi> waſhing, as that of new-born Infants was, and as Baptiſm may ſeem to have been intended for, becauſe repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56517:56"/>as the <hi>laver</hi>
                        <note n="(u)" place="margin">Tit. 3.5.</note> 
                        <hi>of our regeneration:</hi> That, though it do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an immerſion, yet requiring ſuch a <hi>general</hi> waſhing at leaſt, as may extend to the whole Body; As other than which cannot anſwer its type, nor yet that general, though internal purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which Baptiſm was intended to repreſent. The ſame is to be ſaid yet more upon the account of our conforming to the Death, and Reſurrection of Chriſt, which we learn from S. <hi>Paul</hi> to have been the deſign of Baptiſm to ſignifie. For, though that might, and was well enough repreſented by the baptized perſons being buried in Baptiſm, and then riſing out of it; yet can it not be ſaid to be ſo, or at leaſt but very imperfectly by the bare pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, or ſprinkling the Baptiſmal Water on him. But there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as there is ſo much the more reaſon to repreſent the Rite of immerſion, as the only legitimate Rite of Baptiſm, becauſe the only one, that can anſwer the ends of its Inſtitution, and thoſe things, which were to be ſignified by it; ſo eſpecially if (as is well known, and undoubtedly of great force) the general pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Primitive Church was agreeable thereto, and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church to this very day. For who can think either the one, or the other would have been ſo tenacious of ſo troubleſome a Rite, were it not that they were well aſſured, as they of the Primitive Church might very well be, of its being the only inſtituted, and legitimate one.</p>
                     <p>How to take off the force of theſe Arguments altogether, is a thing I mean not to conſider; Partly, becauſe our Church<note n="(w)" place="margin">See the Rubrick in the Office of Baptiſm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>words, <hi>I baptize thee,</hi>
                           </hi> &amp;c.</note> ſeems to perſuade ſuch an immerſion, and partly, becauſe I cannot but think the forementioned Arguments to be ſo far of force, as to evince the neceſſity thereof, where there is not ſome greater ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to occaſion an alteration of it. For what benefit can Men ordinarily expect from that, which depends for its force upon the will of him, that inſtituted it, where there is not ſuch a compliance at leaſt with it, and the Commands of the Inſtituter, as may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thoſe ends, for which he appointed it? And indeed, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may have been done to Infants, which I no way doubt were more or leſs baptized from the beginning, the firſt mention we find of <hi>Aſperſion</hi> in the Baptiſm of the Elder ſort, was in the caſe of the <hi>Clinici,</hi> or Men who receiv'd Baptiſm upon their ſick Beds; and that Baptiſm repreſented by S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>

For, the ſeveral ends of Baptiſm being thus ſecur'd, there was ſtill the leſs reaſon to be ſcrupulous about the means, or think God would be rigorous in exacting them. But ſo they might be yet more aſſur'd (as it appears St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
                        <note n="†" place="margin">Ubi ſupra.</note> was) by what the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ezekiel</hi>

                        </note> ſo applying this, and the like paſſages; So we cannot therefore bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter interpret the <hi>ſprinkling of clean Water</hi> upon them in order to it, than of the Water of Baptiſm, and which the Spirit of God expreſſing by the term of <hi>ſprinkling of</hi> Water ſhews it to have foreſeen a neceſſity of its being ſo adminiſtred oftentimes, and his own allowance of it. All which things whoſoever ſhall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, will, I doubt not, ſee reaſon enough to think, that neceſſity may juſtifie an <hi>Aſperſion</hi> in Baptiſm, and nothing more therefore left to enquire upon this Head, than what may be look'd upon as ſuch a neceſſity, which will bring the queſtion yet nearer to our ſelves. Now as there can be no doubt of <hi>ſickneſs</hi> being ſuch, and particularly ſuch a ſickneſs, as faſtens Men to their <hi>Beds;</hi> So we ſhall therefore have nothing more to conſider of, than the caſe of <hi>Infants,</hi> and to whom as Baptiſm is generally adminiſtred, ſo it is alſo perform'd by an effuſion, or ſprinkling. With what neceſſity, is the thing we are to enquire, and ſo much the rather becauſe the <hi>Greek</hi> Church uſeth immerſion, or dipping to this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, and the <hi>Muſcovitiſh</hi> Church after its example. For if the coldneſs of any Clime may be thought to make that Rite dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to ſuch tender Bodies, one would think they of the <hi>latter</hi> ſhould find it to be ſuch, and therefore ſee a neceſſity of chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. For the clearing whereof we are to know, that as they, who uſe the Rite of immerſion, even in warmer Countries, are ſo ſenſible of the tenderneſs of Infant Bodies, that they make uſe of warm Water to baptize them; So the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> making uſe of it without any danger (if yet they always do ſo) will not make it ceaſe to be ſuch to Infants of other Countries: There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as every one knows, no ſmall difference between the Bodies of Infants, as well as thoſe of Men, and to ſome of whom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and in ſome Countries that may be exceeding dangerous, which Infants of other Countries find no ſuch inconvenience by. And indeed as ſuch an Immerſion of Infants, eſpecially in theſe Northern parts, cannot generally be thought to be without its ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, how warily and carefully ſoever managed; As it may be yet more hazardous to weaker Infants, and whom, as it would not be thought fit to deny Baptiſm to, ſo as little, to do any thing to ſend them out of the World; ſo I am apt enough to believe upon ſecond thoughts (for I have <hi>elſewhere</hi>
                        <note n="(c)" place="margin">Expl. of the Creed, in the Words, <hi>And Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</hi>
                        </note> ſpoken more harſhly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it) that that Rite came to be diſuſed here after a ſufficient proof of the inconveniencies thereof; Becauſe (as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> notes<note n="(d)" place="margin">Vid. Pamel. in not. ad Cypr. epiſt. ad Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</note>) it was in uſe among us, even in his time, and the <hi>Liturgies,</hi> that have been in force ſince, not excepting the preſent one, ſeem rather to perſwade the uſe of it. For our Fore fathers being ſo ſtrangely tenacious of that Rite, and both they, and their poſterity not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a venerable opinion of it, it cannot well be thought they ſhould come at length ſo generally to diſuſe it, but that they found by experience, that it was not without its hazard, and ſo more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently omitted. However it be, our Church hath acquitted it ſelf from all blame, becauſe manifeſtly licenſing<note n="(e)" place="margin">See the Rubr. of Bapt. before the Words, <hi>I baptize thee,</hi> &amp;c.</note> the <hi>ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> of Infants with reſpect to the weakneſs of their State; And I have the more carefully noted both that, and the ground of our
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56517:57"/>practice, the better to defend our ſelves from a retort of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts, when we charge them with Sacrilege in the matter of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> for taking away the <hi>Cup</hi> from the Laity. For why not (as they ſometime anſwer) as well as change the Rite of <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion</hi> in <hi>Baptiſm</hi> into that of <hi>ſprinkling?</hi> Eſpecially, when a great part of the Symbolicalneſs of that Sacrament lies in the manner of the application of its ſign. Which Anſwer of theirs were not in my opinion eaſie to be repel'd, were it not, that we have that neceſſity to juſtifie our practice, which they cannot pretend for their own.</p>
                     <p>Having thus ſaid enough concerning the applying of the outward ſign of Baptiſm, whether by an Immerſion, or Aſperſion, which was the firſt thing I had to conſider; Enquire we in the next place how often that application ought to be made, that is to ſay whether as many times as there are perſons in the God-head, into which we baptize, or once for all into the three. The ground of which queſtion is not only that <hi>diſtinct</hi> profeſſion of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> which Baptiſm was intended to declare, but the appearance there is of the Churches uſing a threefold immerſion from the beginning. For, not to mention any other proofs, <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who flouriſhed within an hundred years after the laſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, doth not only mention the threefold immerſion, as a thing in uſe in his time, but as a thing which was derived to them from<note n="*" place="margin">Tert. de Coronâ, c. <hi>3.</hi> Ergo quaeramus, an &amp; Traditio niſi ſcripta non debeat recipi.

And thus much certainly ought to be allow'd to this, and other teſtimonies, that in or near the Apoſtolical Age, the more fully to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs that diſtinction of perſons, into the Faith of which Chriſt commanded to baptize, Men were with the command, or allowance of thoſe who preſided in the Church, plunged into the Baptiſmal Water at the mention of each per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's name. But as that threefold immerſion cannot be collected from the command of Chriſt, becauſe ſimply enjoyning to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize into the Faith of the Trinity, and which one immerſion may declare as well as a threefold one; As there is as little appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſuch a threefold immerſion from the account we have in the Scripture of the adminiſtration of it: So it is but reaſonable to think, that as ancient as it was, yet it was poſtnate to the ſingle one, and had its riſe from ſome Men's beginning to call the Doctrine of the Trinity in queſtion (as we find by <hi>Tertullian</hi> they did very early) and, the better to colour their own errour, as well as to overthrow the other, admoniſhing Men from S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that Baptiſm was peculiarly intended to baptize Men into Chriſt's <hi>death.</hi> For beſide that they, who conſider the primitive face of Chriſtianity, will need no other proof than that to perſwade them to believe, that the more ſimple any Rite is, ſo much the more ancient it ought to be thought to be; That <hi>Apoſtolick Canon</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. As touching the additions, which were anciently made in this particular, and concerning which they, who deſire an account, may meet with an ample one in Dr. <hi>Cave</hi>'s <hi>Primitive Chriſtianity</hi>
                        <note n="(f)" place="margin">Part 1. c. 10.</note>; They were either ſuch, as they thought more peculiarly warranted to them by an Apoſtolical Tradition, of which nature till better information I muſt needs think the triple Immerſion to have been, or ſuch as were brought into the Church by thoſe, who preſided in it, the more effectually to declare the intention of that Sacrament, to which they were added by it. Which they thought they might moſt aſſuredly do, if they made uſe of ſuch farther Rites, as did repreſent yet more to their ſenſes what that Sacrament was intended to declare. And indeed, as that way of Inſtruction was in part warranted by the Sacraments themſelves, becauſe profeſſing by ſenſible things to teach Men Spiritual ones; As it became yet more neceſſary by the groſneſs of the Vulgar ſort, and that infinity of Ceremonies, to which they had been before accuſtomed: So that, which afterwards made them faulty, was either the exceeding <hi>multitude</hi> thereof (and which experience aſſures us doth rather obſcure, yea overwhelm the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by them, than help toward the declaration of it) or their advancing by degrees into the ſame repute, or neceſſity with the ſigns of Chriſt's own Inſtitution. Which is ſo true, that they came in fine to be repreſented, as means, and conveyers of Grace, as well as ſignificative thereof; Thereby making them Sacraments, rather than appendages of ſuch; and which whoſoever goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to do, muſt neceſſarily uſurp the place of God, and Chriſt, as to whom alone it doth belong (becauſe the only givers of Spiritual Graces) to make any ceremony the conveyer of them. But as that Church, whoſe Catechiſm I explain, hath been ſo far from multiplying Rites in Baptiſm, that ſhe hath contented her ſelf with one ſingle one, even the Sign of the <hi>Croſs;</hi> So ſhe hath ſo explain'd her own meaning in it, both in that form of words<note n="(g)" place="margin">In the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Bapt.</note>, wherewith ſhe appointeth it to be made, and in a Canon<note n="(h)" place="margin">Can. 30.</note> deviſed expreſly for that purpoſe, that it will not be eaſie for conſiderate Men to believe, that ſhe repreſents it as a Sacrament, or indeed that ſhe may not require the conformity of her Children to it. Only, becauſe they, who ſeparate from
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56517:58"/>the Church, have made the injunction of that Ceremony one of the particular reaſons of their ſeparation, and occaſion may well be taken from thence to ſhew the ground both of that, and others, which are as yet retained in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I will ſet my ſelf to conſider the exceptions, that have been made againſt it, and return a particular anſwer to them.</p>
                     <p>Now there are three ſorts of charges, which are brought againſt this Ceremony, and which therefore it will be neceſſary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider; Its being a Ceremony, and ſo Ieſs agreeable to a ſpiritual, and ſubſtantial Religion; Its being an addition to the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, and therefore implying ſomething of imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in that; As laſtly, its being a relique of Popery, or giving too much countenance to the errors of it.</p>
                     <p>The firſt of theſe is certainly one of the moſt unreaſonable charges, that were ever advanced againſt our Church by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries thereof. As will appear if we conſider the nature of thoſe, for whoſe edification that, and the like Ceremonies were intended, The uſe ſuch things are of to procure reſpect to thoſe Inſtitutions, to which they are annexed, And the nature of that Religion, with whoſe Offices they are intermixed.</p>
                     <p>That I alledge as one ground of this, and the like Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the very nature of thoſe Men, for whoſe edification they were intended, is their being compoſed of Fleſh, as well as Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and conſequently the need they ſtand in of ſuch ſenſible helps to awaken their underſtandings to conſider, and their affections to embrace what they were deſigned to repreſent. For being ſo fram'd, it is not eaſie to believe, that, if there were not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in all actions of moment to affect Men's ſenſe, they would intend them as they ought, or be duly affected with them. Of which yet if any doubt be made, we have the conſtant practice of the World to juſtifie it, becauſe rarely, if ever, ſuffering that, which was ſuch (though there wanted not words to expreſs their meaning) to paſs without ſome viſible ſolemnities. Thus, as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>

Of which, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56517:59"/>infinite other inſtances, that might be produced, what account can be given, but that Men have generally thought ſuch ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities but requiſite to imprint the things, to which they were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, upon the minds of thoſe, that were concern'd, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a due eſtimate thereof?

Do not thoſe Robes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are differenced from other Men, draw the Eyes of the Vulgar to them, yea mind them of that greater difference there is between the Judges, and themſelves, as to that power, wherewith they are alſo inveſted? Have not the ſame perſons therefore (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever clamour hath been rais'd againſt things of that nature) kept up them, and the like ſolemnities among them? Have they not done it in thoſe very inſtances, which have been ſcrupled at in the Church? For how ſuperſtitious a thing in a Biſhop, or other Clergy Man hath the uſe of that Cap been, which theſe earthly Gods the Judges, and when they are about their great Maſter's work, do not only not ſcruple at, but diligently retain? As know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that ſuch <hi>marks of diſtinction</hi> do naturally lead Men to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe perſons, or things, to which they are apply'd, as of a peculiar nature, and accordingly, if they deſerve it, to reſpect them. And if ſuch be the uſefulneſs of external ſolemnities in other matters, why ſhould they be excluded from our Religion? Nay, why ſhould they not (conſidering the momentouſneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be rather applied to it?</p>
                     <p>Eſpecially if we conſider thirdly <hi>the nature of that Religion,</hi> with whoſe Offices they are intermixed by us. For though that do more peculiarly call us to the intending of ſpiritual things; Though it do loudly proclaim the abrogation of the Ceremonial Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and not obſcurely condemn the ſubſtituting of any the like burdenſome one: Yet as it no where condemns ſuch a number of Ceremonies, as may ſerve the better to lead Men to the contemplation, and regard of ſpiritual things, ſo it gives a ſufficient countenance to them by the Sacraments I am now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by thoſe other uſances, which were in vogue with the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56517:59"/>firſt Profeſſors of it. For how can that Religion be look'd upon as an enemy to Ceremonies, which requires Men to be initiated into it by the <hi>water, and immerſion of Baptiſm?</hi> Yea to keep up their intereſt in it by partaking of the <hi>Bread, and Wine of the Euchariſt,</hi> thoſe ſigns of our Saviour's Crucified Body, and of the ſpiritual benefits we reap by it? And though we do not find that our Saviour inſtituted any other Ceremonies, or at leaſt not with a deſign of giving them the ſame laſting obligation; Yet as we find our Saviour giving command to his Diſciples, when he firſt ſent them out to Preach, <hi>to ſhake off the duſt of their Feet</hi>
                        <note n="(p)" place="margin">Mark 6.11.</note> againſt thoſe that would not hear them, as a teſtimony of their contempt of God's word, and of their own reſolution not to have to do with them in the like kind, which was a kind of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of them; So we find that <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> (though under no obligation from the former command, becauſe but a temporary one) <hi>ſhook off the duſt of their feet</hi>
                        <note n="(q)" place="margin">Acts 13.51.</note> againſt thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> that rejected, and expelled them, as the ſame S. <hi>Paul</hi> after that, when the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Corinth</hi> oppoſed themſelves, and blaſphem'd, <hi>ſhaking his raiment</hi> at them<note n="(r)" place="margin">Acts 18.6.</note>, as a teſtimony of his rejecting them, in like manner, and leaving them to go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Gentiles. For what was this but to declare by a ſignificant Ceremony, that as they had rejected the Counſel of God toward themſelves, ſo God had rejected them in like manner, neither would that his Miniſters ſhould make the like propoſals to them? The ſame is yet more to be ſaid upon the account of <hi>Impoſition of hands,</hi> and which, though from no Command of Chriſt, was either uſed, or approved by the Apoſtles themſelves, both in the <hi>Ordination</hi> of Miniſters<note n="(ſ)" place="margin">2 Tim. 1.6.</note>, and <hi>receiving penitent</hi> Sinners to Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution<note n="(t)" place="margin">1 Tim. 5.22.</note>, and pardon. For theſe being noted Acts of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which we profeſs, and yet by the allowance of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles themſelves tranſacted by the Ceremony of Impoſition of Hands, make it evident, that our Religion doth rather commend, than reject ſuch viſible ſolemnities, where they are ſparingly, and diſcreetly apply'd.</p>
                     <p>That <hi>firſt</hi> charge againſt the ſign of the Croſs being thus wip'd off, even that which pretends to diſcard it upon the account of its being a Ceremony; Let us ſee, whether it be likely to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any more by the pretence of its being <hi>an addition of Men to the Inſtitution of Chriſt,</hi> yea to one, <hi>that is not without viſible ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of his own appointment:</hi> Such additions ſeeming to imply the <hi>imperfection</hi> of that, to which they are made, and which there is the leſs reaſon to believe in the preſent affair, becauſe care hath been taken by our Saviour as to the outward form of its Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, as well as to more material things. And ſurely ſo ſuch <hi>Additions</hi> might very well be thought to do, if either they were repreſented as of the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the Sacrament, or our Saviour had profeſſed to <hi>preſcribe,</hi> or direct the <hi>whole form</hi> of the Adminiſtration of it. But as it is notorious enough, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth not repreſent the ſign of the <hi>Croſs</hi> as pertaining to the Eſſence of the Sacrament, becauſe adminiſtring it after Baptiſm firſt given, yea after the mention of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter's <hi>receiving</hi> the baptized perſon into the <hi>Congregation of Chriſt's
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56517:60"/>flock;</hi> So our Saviour is ſo far from preſcribing the whole external form of its Adminiſtration, that he hath left us to the general te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Doctrine, and the directions of our own reaſon, even for thoſe things that are more material, yea for ſuch as are dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted<note n="(u)" place="margin">See the Directory in the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Baptiſm.</note> by thoſe very Men, who cry out againſt us for adding to Chriſt's Inſtitution. For where, I beſeech you, is there any preſcription of other words concerning Baptiſm, than what is imply'd in that ſhort belief, into which he commands to Baptize? Where to admoniſh all, that are preſent, to look back to their own Baptiſm, and to repent of the violations of the Covenant they made with God in it? Where any directions for requiring the Parent of the Child to bring him up in the nurture of the Lord, yea to require the Parents ſolemn promiſe for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it? Nay where, which is of all others the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, any Prayer to Almighty God for the ſanctifying of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he is going to make uſe of, and which I no way doubt is neceſſary to the Conſecration of it? All, that the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of Baptiſm repreſents to us, being the baptizing thoſe, that offer themſelves to it, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt. Now if our Saviour hath not profeſſed to preſcribe, even as to the things before directed, but left Men to the general conduct of his Doctrine, and the guidance of their own reaſon; What appearance is there as to his preſcribing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what external form, and order, all theſe things were to be done, and which if he hath not, there is no doubt the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Church may order, as they ſhall ſee fit, yea do ſo without any fear of being thought to charge his Inſtitutions with imperfection? They being not to be thought to do ſo, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe rules concerning thoſe things, which the Inſtitutions of Chriſt profeſs not to give perfect directions in. The only thing, which hath occaſion'd Men's miſapprehenſions firſt, and then their paſſing ſo ſevere a Cenſure upon humane preſcriptions in this kind, is an haſty opinion they have taken up of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s being as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular in directing the external management of ſacred Duties, as <hi>Moſes</hi> appears to have been as to the ſervices of the Law. For which yet they have had no other pretence, than a miſapplied Text of the <hi>Author to the Hebrews</hi>
                        <note n="(w)" place="margin">Heb. 3.2.</note>, even <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s being as <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in that houſe of God,</hi> which was committed to his charge, as <hi>Moſes was in his.</hi> But beſide that there appear not any ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular directions from God to our <hi>Saviour,</hi> as there were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time given to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and our Saviour therefore not to be look'd upon as unfaithful, for not reaching out ſuch particular directions to us; Beſides that, if our Saviour did not furniſh ſuch particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar directions, yet he hath furniſhed his Church with a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter portion of his Spirit, and which may ſerve to it as a guide to fit thoſe Services for its reſpective members; Beſide laſtly that the Services he enjoyn'd, becauſe to be exerciſed among people of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Nations, and humours, were not capable, as to circumſtances, of ſuch ſtrict limitations, as that, which was to be exerciſed in one ſingle Nation only: There is nothing more evident to thoſe, that read the Scriptures, than that Chriſt hath given no ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular directions, and all Arguments from Chriſt's <hi>fidelity</hi> therefore
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56517:60"/>of no more avail in this affair, than thoſe, which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are wont to draw from the <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>goodneſs of God,</hi> toward the proving of an <hi>Infallible</hi> Guide. For as no wiſe Man will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by ſuch Arguments againſt the Teſtimony of his own ſenſes, which aſſure him of the errours of thoſe, whom they would have to be Infallible; So no conſidering Man will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by the other into a belief of thoſe particular directions, which are not any where to be ſeen, nor which they themſelves, who maintain thoſe directions, have yet been able to ſhew. For when they have ſaid all they can toward the evincing of their Concluſion, the utmoſt they are able to prove is, that Chriſt hath given ſome general directions concerning the Adminiſtration of religious Offices, and which as it doth not prejudge the giving of more particular ones, ſo doth much leſs make them to reflect any imperfection upon the Inſtitution of Chriſt, becauſe pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not to concern it ſelf about them.</p>
                     <p>One other Charge there is, which is more peculiar to the ſign of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and that is its being a <hi>relique of Popery,</hi> or <hi>giving too much countenance to the Papiſts abuſes</hi> of it. But as they, who advance the former of theſe, make <hi>Popery</hi> much more Antient, than it is for the advantage of <hi>Proteſtantiſm</hi> to allow; It being certain from <hi>Tertullian</hi>
                        <note n="(x)" place="margin">De Coronâ cap. <hi>3.</hi>
                        </note>, that this Ceremony was in uſe in his time in almoſt all the actions they ſet about: So our Church hath taken care to prevent in its own Members all miſapplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it, or the giving the leaſt encouragement to thoſe, that are made of it by others; Partly by confining the uſe of it to the Adminiſtration of Baptiſm, and partly by repreſenting it as only a <hi>token</hi> of Men's being not aſhamed to own the Faith, and reproaches of him, who ſuffered upon it. Which is certainly a more proper courſe to diſcountenance Popery, than it can be thought to be to remove the uſe of it altogether: Becauſe at the ſame time we diſavow the errors of that, we ſhew by our Practice our allowance of the Ceremony it ſelf, and, together therewith, our accordance with the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church, which is the only plauſible thing the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have to boulſter up their own cauſe, or reproach us with the neglect of.</p>

                        <p>Of the ground of the preſent <hi>Digreſſion</hi> concerning <hi>Original Sin,</hi> and enquiry thereupon made, <hi>what</hi> Original Sin is.

The nature of that corruption more <hi>particularly</hi> enquir'd into, and ſhewn by probable Arguments to be no other, than a Privation of a Supernatural Grace. That there is ſuch a thing, as we have before deſcribed, evidenced at large from the Scripture, and that evidence farther ſtrengthned by the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence we have of its effects, and the acknowledgments of the wiſer Heathen. Enquiry next made from whence it had its beginning, which is ſhewn to have been not from any evil Spirit, or <hi>Daemon,</hi> the pravity of matter, or the evil habits the Soul contracted in a praeexiſtent ſtate, but from the pravity of our firſt Parents. This
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56517:62"/>laſt at large confirm'd out of the Doctrine of the Scripture, and followed by ſome light reflections upon the means, by which it is conveyed. A more juſt account from the Scripture of its being truly, and properly a ſin, partly from its having the title of a ſin, but more eſpecially from its being repreſented as ſuch, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our Obligation to the contrary.

                     <p n="1">I. To begin with the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe, even what <hi>Original Sin</hi> is, and which, in the general, may be defin'd to be ſuch a <hi>Corruption of the nature of every Man, that is naturally ingendred of the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of</hi> Adam, <hi>whereby it becomes averſe from every thing, that is good, and inclin'd to every thing, that is evil.</hi> I call it a <hi>Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nature</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from <hi>nature</hi> conſidered <hi>in it ſelf,</hi> and as it was in the firſt formation of it: Partly, becauſe Nature being, as ſuch, the work of God, cannot be ſuppoſed to be corrupt; And partly becauſe the Scripture aſſures us, that whatſoever it now is, God made it upright<note n="*" place="margin">Eccl. 7.29.</note>, and ſo free from all corruptions whatſoever. But ſo alſo do I entitle it the Corruption of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>every Man, that is naturally ingendred of the off-ſpring of Adam:</hi> Partly, becauſe the Scripture, where it entreats of it, repreſents <hi>all Men</hi> as under the Contagion of it, and partly to exempt our <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>Saviour</hi> from it, who was ingendred after another manner, and whom the ſame Scripture aſſures to have

                        <hi>from his Birth.</hi> I call it laſtly ſuch a Corruption of humane Nature, whereby it is <hi>averſe from every thing, that is good, and inclin'd to every thing, that is evil.</hi> Which I do upon the account of the Scripture's repreſenting it as a <hi>ſinful</hi>
                        <note n="(a)" place="margin">Pſa. 51.5.</note> one, and which, as ſuch, will make thoſe in whom it is, <hi>averſe from good,</hi> as well as <hi>inclinable to evil,</hi> yea averſe from <hi>all,</hi> that is good, and inclinable to <hi>all</hi> evil: Becauſe good, yea all good is oppoſite to ſuch an eſtate, and evil, yea all evil connatural to it. If they, in whom that corruption of nature doth as yet abide, be not always actually prevail'd upon to reject that good, from which we have affirm'd them to be ſo averſe, or to purſue that evil, to which we have affirm'd them to be inclinable, it is not becauſe they want any averſeneſs for the one, or inclination to the other, but for ſome other collateral conſiderations: Such as is, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the reputation, or advantage, that may accrue to them from the eſpouſing of any thing, that is good, or the omiſſion of any thing, that is evil. For all good, and all evil being of one uniform nature, becauſe becoming good or evil by the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity they bear to the divine Laws, or by their deviation from them; where there is an inclination to any thing, that is good, there muſt be an inclination to all, that is of the ſame nature; as on the other ſide where an averſeneſs from any thing, that is evil, an averſeneſs for all that, which is alike a tranſgreſſion of the Divine Laws. But as therefore nothing can hinder us from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting natural corruption as making Men averſe from all that is good, and inclinable to every thing that is evil; So neither can any thing oblige us to extend the force of it ſo far, as to make it to determine them in all their actions, and accordingly to carry them to an actual rejection of all, that is good, or a purſuance of all, that is evil: Partly becauſe Men may, and often do act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their natural averſions, or inclinations, where there is hope of temporal advantage, or fear of any temporal evil; And part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe we do not only find few natural Men proceeding to the extremity of Impiety, but find alſo great variety among them in the omiſſion of good Actions, or the commiſſion of thoſe that are evil. Of which variety what account could be given, when the Corruption of Nature is, and muſt be equal, becauſe all Men were alike in, and are alike deſcended from <hi>Adam,</hi> were it not that even that Corruption leaves place for the performance of many good, and the avoiding of many things, that are evil? For to aſcribe that variety either wholly, or principally to the different degrees of God's reſtraining Grace, is not only to ſpeak without all Authority, that I know of, but to take away all diverſity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the evil demerits of natural Men, and, together therewith, all different degrees of puniſhment; yea to make the Corruption of Nature the only proper ground of puniſhment. For as, if there be nothing but God's reſtraining Grace to take off natural Men from falling into the worſt of ſins, the greateſt actual ſinner cannot deſerve more puniſhment, than he who offends in a far leſs degree; Becauſe all demerit ariſeth from the pravity of the will, which is not more or leſs for the meer abſence, or preſence of God's reſtraining Grace: So the greateſt actual ſinner cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56517:63"/>obnoxious to puniſhment upon the ſcore of any other Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption than that of Nature; That as it makes all his actual ſins to be neceſſary, and therefore in reaſon to bear the whole blame, and puniſhment, ſo receiving no new aggravation from the want of that reſtraining Grace, which might have withheld the party from them, in as much as that want (if it be a fault) is no leſs the reſult of his natural corruption, than his actual offences are. But therefore alſo as we cannot look upon natural corruption as determining Men to all their actual errours, without taking away all diverſity between the demerits of natural Men, yea making natural Corruption the only proper ground of their puniſhment; ſo they, who do ſo, will be found to contradict the declarations of the Scripture, as well as the allowed practice of the World. For why, if there be no difference between the demerits of natural Men, ſhould thoſe, that are in Authority, mete out different puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to them according to the different degrees, or kinds of thoſe offences, which they commit? Nay, why ſhould the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture affirm, that it ſhall be <hi>more tolerable</hi> for ſome ſinners<note n="(b)" place="margin">Matt. 11.22, 24.</note>, than for others at the great day of judgment? That, as it is a judgment of righteouſneſs, ſo being conſequently to mete out equal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to all ſinners, if there be but an equality in their demerits. Again, if natural Corruption be upon the matter the only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ground of puniſhment, as it muſt of neceſſity be, if it be the unavoidable cauſe of actual ſins; How comes the Scripture to declare, that God will <hi>reward every Man according</hi> to his works<note n="(c)" place="margin">Rom. 2.6.</note>, yea the wicked<note n="(d)" place="margin">Rom. 2.8.</note> according to his works, as well as the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous according to theirs? For if natural Corruption be the only proper ground of puniſhment, the works of Men <hi>in propriety of Speech</hi> can have no concernment in it, and much leſs (as the Scripture declares) be the principal object of judgment, and therefore of that puniſhment, which it ſhall award. The utmoſt in my opinion, that can be ſaid in this particular, is that as Men by the Corruption of their Nature are averſe from every thing, that is good, ſo that averſeneſs will indiſpoſe thoſe, in whom that Corruption abides, to all good actions whatſoever, and infallibly take them off from them, where either ſome work of God upon their minds doth not thruſt them on to them, or the comelineſs, or profitableneſs thereof ſhall not more ſtrongly impel them to the practice of them. The <hi>former</hi> whereof will make the conſent of ſuch perſons even to thoſe good actions, which they perform, incomplete, and imperfect, and indeed a conſent to them rather as expedient, than good; whence it is that our Church<note n="(e)" place="margin">Art. 13.</note> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents them as <hi>having the nature of ſins:</hi> The <hi>latter</hi> cauſe them to neglect all ſuch, as are not in a manner thruſt upon them by God, or have not one of the former motives to incite them to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of them, yea preſent to their minds, when they ought to make uſe of them. Which will occaſion ſuch perſons for the moſt part to neglect all good actions, where there is not place for ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts, as in caſes of ſurpriſe, or where they have not been habituated to the practice of vertue, or to the conſideration of the comelineſs or profitableneſs thereof. But as where there is place for ſerious thoughts, there may be place alſo for the former mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56517:63"/>to impel Men to the practice of that, from which they are otherwiſe ſufficiently averſe; So it is not unlikely that the minds of thoſe, who have been before habituated to the practice, or contemplation of Vertue, may be thruſt on by the former motives to purſue many things, that are good, yea acquit themſelves ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in them. Of which yet if any doubt be made, we have the laudable example of ſeveral Heathens to convince us thereof, and who, becauſe Heathen, cannot be ſuppoſed to be free from the power of natural Corruption, or to be thruſt on by other motives, than the former, to the doing of ſuch actions, from which they are naturally ſo averſe. In like manner, As Men by the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of their Nature are inclin'd to every thing that is evil, as well as averſe from every thing that is good; So that inclination will diſpoſe thoſe, in whom it is, to an allowance of all evil acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and infallibly betray them into them, where God's reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace doth not withhold them, or the indecency, or dangerous conſequences of the other do not alike keep them back. The <hi>former</hi> whereof will make their abſtaining even from thoſe evil actions, which they avoid, to be but an imperfect abſtinence from them, and indeed an abſtinence from them rather as inexpedient, than evil; The <hi>latter</hi> cauſe them to fall into all ſuch, from which they are not reſtrain'd by God, or by a preſent, and intenſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the indecency, or danger of them. Which will occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſuch perſons for the moſt part to fall into all evil actions, where there is not room for ſerious thoughts, as in caſes of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, or where they have not been habituated to the avoiding of vice, or the conſideration of the indecency, or dangerouſneſs thereof. But as, where there is room for ſerious thoughts, there may alſo be place for the former reaſons to take them off from the practice of that, to which they are otherwiſe ſufficiently inclin'd; So it is not unlikely, that the minds of thoſe, who have been before habituated to the avoiding of Vice, or the conſideration of the indecency, or dangerouſneſs thereof, may be taken off by the former reaſons from the purſuit of evil things, yea acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſingularly in it. As is farther evident from the reſiſtance, that hath been made by ſeveral Heathens to all the temptations of ſin, and who, becauſe Heathen, cannot be ſuppos'd either to have been free from natural Corruption, or to have been taken off by other means, than the former, from the doing of thoſe evil actions, to which they were ſo ſtrongly inclin'd.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe what we have hitherto ſaid concerning the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Nature doth rather tend to ſhew <hi>what effects</hi> it hath upon us, than what that Corruption is; And becauſe that <hi>word,</hi> whereby we have choſen to expreſs it, is but a <hi>Metaphorical</hi> one, and will therefore ſerve yet leſs clearly to declare the thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by it; Therefore it may ſeem but reaſonable to enquire yet farther, <hi>what</hi> it <hi>is,</hi> and <hi>wherein</hi> it doth <hi>conſiſt,</hi> as without which we ſhall diſcourſe but imperfectly concerning it. Now as that queſtion cannot otherwiſe be ſolv'd, than by the knowledge of that <hi>Eſtate,</hi> of which it is affirm'd to be a Corruption; So I ſhall therefore enquire again what that <hi>Eſtate</hi> was, and then what <hi>relation</hi> this <hi>Corruption</hi> beareth to it. As touching that eſtate,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56517:64"/>wherein God did at firſt create our Nature, moſt certain it is firſt (for ſo <hi>Solomon</hi>
                        <note n="(f)" place="margin">Eccl. 7.29.</note> affirms it to be) that it was an eſtate of <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs,</hi> that is to ſay ſuch an eſtate as fitted Man for the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all thoſe Laws, which God had obliged him to perform. That, as it is the moſt uſual ſignification of the <hi>word</hi> we render <hi>upright,</hi> and accordingly rendred by the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſt <hi>right, and innocent</hi> before God, ſo beſt anſwering the account before gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven concerning the depravation of humane Nature, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in thoſe of the Female Sex. For <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaking in the <hi>26th</hi> verſe of the deceitfulneſs of that Sex, and of the influence that deceitfulneſs of theirs would have upon ſinful Men; Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming afterwards becauſe repreſenting the event of his ſearch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the deſires of his Soul, that though he could <hi>find one Man among a thouſand</hi> of a better temper, yet he could not find <hi>One</hi> ſuch <hi>Woman</hi> among them all; He muſt conſequently, when he comes to ſay that he found only that <hi>God made Man</hi> upright, be thought to mean ſuch an uprightneſs, as was oppoſite to that general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation, whereof he before complain'd. There being therefore no doubt to be made that God created our Nature in a ſtate of <hi>uprightneſs,</hi> even in ſuch a one as fitted Man for the obedience of all thoſe Laws, which he was obliged to comply with; En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire we in the ſecond place wherein that ſtate of uprightneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, but which we ſhall not find to be of ſo eaſie a reſolution, as the former: Becauſe there is ſome preſumption of its conſiſting in a right diſpoſition of our natural faculties; And there is ſome preſumption of its conſiſting in a ſupernatural Grace over-ruling, and directing thoſe natural faculties to thoſe pious purpoſes, for which they were chiefly deſign'd. We have to perſuade the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of theſe the natural ability of the underſtanding to diſcern the inviſible things of God by the things, which he hath made, and the natural propenſion of the Will to embrace that, which is good, and therefore alſo the chiefeſt good, where that is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apprehended, and where there is no depravation in the Will (as to be ſure there was not at firſt) to draw it to leſſer ones. In fine, we have to perſwade it the power the ſuperiour faculties of the Soul have even now over the Inferiour ones, and which we may well believe in that ſtate of Innocency to have been of ſufficient force to keep them within thoſe bounds, which God, and Nature had ſet them. This, I ſay, we have to perſwade that uprightneſs, wherein our firſt Parents were Created, to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in a right diſpoſition of their natural faculties; And we are not without reaſon on the other hand to perſwade the ſame up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs of Nature to have conſiſted in its being over-ruled, and directed by a ſupernatural Grace: Becauſe without ſuch a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Grace our firſt Parents could not have come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, but by the knowledge of Created Beings, and the excellencies thereof, and (what that knowledge would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd) a love, and affection for them. Which would not only have made God to be lov'd after his Creatures, who as being the firſt, and chiefeſt good ought to have the precedency thereof, but endangered alſo the diminution of our affections to him by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion of them by the other. To which of theſe two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56517:64"/>to give the preeminency is hard to ſay, and I will not therefore be over poſitive in determining concerning the force of them, nor therefore, whether Original Righteouſneſs were a right diſpoſition of our natural faculties, or a ſupernatural Grace over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling, and directing them. But as how equal ſoever thoſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings may be in themſelves, yet nothing will hinder our incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning rather to the one, than the other, if the Scripture, which is the beſt judge of things of that nature, ſeem to favour ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination; So I muſt needs ſay that the Scripture<note n="(g)" place="margin">Gen. 1.28, &amp;c. Gen. 2.19, &amp;c.</note> ſeems to favour thoſe reaſonings, which makes Original Righteouſneſs to be a Supernatural Grace: Becauſe not only repreſenting <hi>Adam</hi> as imbued from the very firſt with the knowledge of God, which yet he could not be without a revelation from him, but as more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over freely converſing with God, and receiving both Laws, and priviledges from him. For as it appears from thence, that God did immediately ſhine upon his mind, and ſo far forth therefore influenced him by a ſupernatural Grace, ſo it is not unlikely that he, who ſo ſhone upon his mind, did as immediately influence his will, and affections, and ſo diſpoſe him to a compliance with thoſe Laws he impos'd upon him: That, as it was but agreeable to the immediate illumination of his underſtanding, ſo becoming yet more neceſſary by the different inclinations of his Fleſh, and Spirit, and which the preſence of a Supernatural Grace may ſeem but requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to bring to a due compliance with each other, and with thoſe Laws, which God had impos'd upon them both. And I ſhall only add, that if that uprightneſs, wherein our Nature was at firſt Created, were no other than a Supernatural Grace, as is at leaſt highly probable from the former reaſonings, and the declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Scripture; We ſhall need to aſſign no other relation of that Corruption of Nature, whereof we ſpeak, than that of a <hi>ſimple privation</hi> of the other. For if the deſires of the Fleſh could ſo far prevail even under a ſupernatural Grace, as to carry our firſt Parents to the eating of that fruit, which God had ſo ſeverely forbidden them; The <hi>ſimple privation</hi> of that ſupernatural Grace may well ſuffice to give birth to all our evil inclinations, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently paſs for a ſufficient account of that Corruption of our Nature, whereby, as I ſaid before, we become inclinable to Evil, as well as averſe from Good, and which what evidence we have of the <hi>being</hi> of, is in the next place to be enquir'd.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Now as we cannot certainly better inform our ſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the preſent ſtate of our Nature, than from him who, as he was the Author of it, ſo is intimately preſent to it; So I will therefore begin with that account, which he hath given us of it, and which we ſhall find to bear an ample Teſtimony to that Corruption, whereof we ſpeak. For the evidencing whereof I will ſhew Firſt, that it affirmeth all Men whatſoever to be under ſin, yea under a perpetual courſe of it. Secondly, that it affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to be ſo from the time they begin to be in a capacity to offend. Thirdly, that they are ſo from a principle bred in them, and derived to them from their birth.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That all Men are under ſin S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſo fully declare, that we ſhall need no other Teſtimony than his to evince it; More
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56517:65"/>particularly, where he affirmeth that <hi>both Jews and Gentiles</hi>
                        <note n="(h)" place="margin">Rom. 3.9.</note> 
                        <hi>are all under ſin;</hi> That though the <hi>former</hi> may ſeem of all others to have been moſt free from it, yet the Law<note n="(i)" place="margin">Rom. 3.19.</note> had not ſtuck to affirm, that <hi>there was none</hi>
                        <note n="(k)" place="margin">Rom. 3.10, &amp;c.</note> 
                        <hi>righteous,</hi> even among them, <hi>no not one;</hi> That <hi>there was none that underſtood, none that ſought after God;</hi> That they were <hi>all gone out of the way, they were altogether become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, that there was none, that did good, no not one;</hi> In fine, that <hi>all the World</hi> muſt thereby<note n="(l)" place="margin">Rom. 3.19.</note> be look'd upon as <hi>guilty before God,</hi> becauſe, as he afterward<note n="(m)" place="margin">Rom. 3.23.</note> ſpeaks, <hi>all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God.</hi> But ſo the ſame Scripture did long before declare, with an addition of all Men's being under a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual courſe of ſin, as well as in ſome meaſure tainted with it; It being not only the voice of God concerning that part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that liv'd before the flood, that <hi>every imagination</hi>
                        <note n="(n)" place="margin">Gen. 6.5.</note> 
                        <hi>of the thought of their heart was only evil continually,</hi> but alike intimated by him concerning that part, which was to follow, even to the end of the World. For affirming, as he doth<note n="(o)" place="margin">Gen. 8.21.</note>, that he would <hi>not any more drown the World,</hi> becauſe <hi>the imagination of Man's heart is evil from his youth,</hi> he both ſuppoſeth that Mankind would again give occaſion to it by their evil imaginations (as without which otherwiſe there could be no occaſion for God's ſuſpending it) and that Mankind would do ſo alſo in every individual, and Generation of it: The <hi>former,</hi> becauſe he ſpeaks of the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Mankind in the general, and which are therefore to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to all the individuals of it; The <hi>latter,</hi> becauſe if any Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Men were likely to be free from thoſe imaginations, there would <hi>ſo far forth</hi> have been no need of his declaring, that he would not drown the World, becauſe no ground for bringing it on the Inhabitants thereof. But therefore, as we have reaſon to believe from the places before recited, that the World always was, and will be under ſin, yea under a conſtant courſe of it; So we ſhall be yet more confirmed in it, if we compare the latter place with the former, as the likeneſs, that is between them, will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige us to do: There being not a more apt ſenſe of that latter Speech of God, than that he would not again drown the Earth, becauſe he knew the imaginations of Men would be as evil as they had before been, and he therefore, if he were diſpos'd to take that vengeance, to bring a flood often upon it, to the no profit of thoſe, that inhabited it, as well as to the defacing of the Earth it ſelf. Which will make the condition of Man to be ſo ſinful, that it cannot be otherwiſe, unleſs by ſome powerful means delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But ſo alſo may we inferr from thence, which was the <hi>ſecond</hi> thing to be prov'd, that all Men are under ſin from the time they begin to be in a capacity to offend: That, as it affirms <hi>the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of Men's heart to be evil,</hi> ſo to be evil <hi>from their Youth,</hi> and, as I ſhould therefore think, from the time they begin to be in a capacity to be guilty of it. Not that that Age, to which we are wont to give the denomination of <hi>Youth,</hi> is the firſt wherein Mankind begins to be in a capacity to offend (for there is but too much evidence of that in the riper years of <hi>Childhood</hi>) but that we cannot well underſtand that Text of any other <hi>youthful Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riode,</hi>
                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:56517:65"/>than that wherein Mankind begins to be in a capacity to reaſon, and conſequently alſo to offend: Partly, becauſe the <hi>word</hi> we render <hi>Youth</hi> is ſometime us'd even for infancy<note n="(p)" place="margin">Judges 13.7. Exod. 2.6.</note>, and ought not therefore without manifeſt reaſon to be removed too far from it; But more eſpecially becauſe it is the manifeſt deſign of God in the place we ſpeak of to aggravate the evil of Men's imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the earlineſs thereof, and that <hi>earlineſs</hi> therefore to be carried as high, as the capacity Men are in to <hi>imagine evil</hi> will ſuffer the doing of it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Now as nothing therefore can be wanting toward the proof of Original Corruption, than that they, who are ſo univerſally, and ſo early under ſin, are ſo alſo from an inward principle, and ſuch an inward principle too, as was derived to them from their birth; ſo we ſhall not it may be need any other proof of that, than their being ſo univerſally, and early under the other: The <hi>former</hi> of theſe perſwading Men's being under ſin from ſome inward prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, the <hi>latter</hi> from ſuch an inward principle, as is deriv'd to them from their Birth. That I make Men's being ſo univerſally under ſin, an argument of their being ſo from ſome inward prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, is becauſe as ſo general an effect muſt be ſuppoſed to have ſome general Cauſe, ſo no external Cauſe, how general ſoever, can be ſuppoſed to produce it without the aſſiſtance of the other. As will appear if we conſider the force of <hi>example,</hi> and which as it is the moſt general, and the moſt effectual external Cauſe, that can be aſſign'd, ſo is that, into which they who deny the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature, are wont to reſolve the univerſality of ſin. For neither firſt is even <hi>Example</hi> of ſo great force, as infallibly, and univerſally to draw Men to the imitation of it; For ſome Men are Vertuous, even when they have an ill example before them, and others as Vitious, where they have a good. Neither ſecondly hath it any force, but what it receives from Men's aptneſs to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate thoſe, with whom they converſe. Which as it will make it neceſſary for us to have recourſe to an inward principle, even for thoſe effects, which are produc'd by the mediation of example, ſo make our very aptneſs to imitate the evil examples of others, a branch of that inward principle, which we affirm to be the cauſe of ſo univerſal an impiety. Only becauſe we are yet upon Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture proofs, and which the more expreſs they are, ſo much the more convictive; Therefore I ſhall yet more particularly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to evince from thence, that as all Men are under ſin, ſo they are ſo by an innate principle. But ſo S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives us clearly enough to underſtand, becauſe both aſſerting ſuch a principle, and that all actual ſins are the iſſues of it: The <hi>former,</hi> where he repreſents even the Man, who was under the conviction of the <hi>Law</hi> (and who therefore might be ſuppos'd to be moſt free from the contagion of ſin) as <hi>Carnal,</hi> yea <hi>ſold under it</hi>
                        <note n="(q)" place="margin">Rom. 7.14.</note>, as one, who had <hi>ſin dwelling in him</hi> (for ſo he affirms no leſs than twice<note n="(r)" place="margin">Rom. 7.17. Rom. 7.20,</note>) and as one too, who had <hi>a law in his members</hi>
                        <note n="(ſ)" place="margin">Rom. 7.23,</note> 
                        <hi>that warred againſt the law of his mind,</hi> or (as he afterwards entitles it) <hi>a law of ſin;</hi> The latter, where he repreſents that <hi>carnality,</hi> and <hi>ſinful captivity,</hi> under which the <hi>Jew</hi> was, as the cauſe of his <hi>doing what he would not</hi>
                        <note n="(t)" place="margin">Rom. 7.15.</note>, <hi>and omitting what he would,</hi> That <hi>ſin, which dwelt in him,</hi>
                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:56517:66"/>as <hi>doing all the evil</hi>
                        <note n="(u)" place="margin">Rom. 17.20.</note> 
                        <hi>he committed,</hi> And that <hi>law, that was in his members,</hi> as <hi>warring againſt the law of his mind</hi>
                        <note n="(w)" place="margin">Rom. 17.23.</note>, <hi>and bringing him into Captivity unto the law of ſin.</hi> For what more could be ſaid on the one hand to ſhew the thing S. <hi>Paul</hi> there ſpeaks of to be an <hi>inward evil principle,</hi> and which, becauſe even in thoſe, who were under the Law, is much more to be ſuppoſed in the Gentiles? Or what more on the other to ſhew that evil principle to be the <hi>parent of our actual ſins,</hi> yea that which gives being to them all. And I know nothing to take off the force of it, but a ſuppoſition of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſpeaking in that place of <hi>Evil habits,</hi> and which as they muſt be confeſſed to be of the ſame pernicious efficacy with Original Corruption, ſo to have been for the moſt part the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition both of <hi>Jew,</hi> and Gentile, before they came to be overtaken by the Goſpel. But how firſt ſuppoſing the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>only</hi> of <hi>evil habits</hi> (for nothing hinders us from aſſigning them a part in that <hi>Body</hi> of ſin) How firſt, I ſay, doth that agree with the account he before gave concerning ſins <hi>entring in</hi>
                        <note n="(x)" place="margin">Rom. 5.12.</note> 
                        <hi>by Adam,</hi> and our being <hi>conſtituted</hi>
                        <note n="(y)" place="margin">Rom. 5.19.</note> 
                        <hi>ſinners</hi> by him. For though Original Corruption may come from him, yet evil habits can be only from our ſelves, and conſequently thoſe ſins, that flow from them? How ſecondly ſuppoſing none but evil habits to be here intended, can we make that <hi>Body,</hi> or <hi>law of ſin,</hi> whereof S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, to be the portion of all, that are under an obligation to Baptiſm, as that Apoſtle plainly ſuppoſeth, when he makes the deſign of Baptiſm<note n="(z)" place="margin">Rom. 6.6.</note> to be <hi>the deſtruction</hi> of it? For to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at preſent concerning the caſe of Infants, becauſe the beſt evidence of their Obligation to Baptiſm is the Corruption of their Nature, and that Obligation therefore rather to be prov'd from Natural Corruption, than Natural Corruption from it; Neither can it be deny'd, even from the Commandment<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 28.19.</note>, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour gave concerning Baptiſm, that all adult perſons are under an Obligation to it, nor therefore but that they carry about them that <hi>body of ſin,</hi> which Baptiſm was intended for the deſtruction of. But ſo all adult perſons cannot be ſuppoſed to do, if that <hi>body</hi> of ſin be no other, than evil habits; Becauſe it muſt be ſometime after that maturity of theirs before they can come to thoſe evil habits, or therefore to be under an Obligation to that <hi>Sacrament</hi> which is to deſtroy it. In fine, how ſuppoſing none but evil ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits to be intended by that <hi>body,</hi> or <hi>law of ſin,</hi> whereof the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks, can we give an account of <hi>ſo holy, and juſt a Law,</hi> as that of <hi>Moſes</hi> is, <hi>ſtirring</hi>
                        <note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 7.9.</note> 
                        <hi>Concupiſcence</hi> in thoſe, that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, and not rather hindring it from coming to effect. For as nothing hinders the propoſing of that Law before ſuch perſons come to any evil habits, and therefore alſo before there is any thing in them to ſtir them up to ſuch a Concupiſcence; So nothing can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Law, when duly propoſed to them, from preventing all ſuch Concupiſcence, as it was the deſign of the Lawgiver to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid: Becauſe as the perſons we ſpeak of muſt be ſuppoſed to be without any contrariety in their Nature to the matter of that Law, which is propos'd; So they muſt alſo be ſuppos'd to be in that ſtate, wherein God had ſet them, and (becauſe God cannot be thought to place Men in any other eſtate, than that of uprightneſs) in ſuch
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56517:66"/>a ſtate, as will make them willing to liſten to the divine Laws, and receive their directions from them. By which means the divine Laws ſhall rather keep Men's Concupiſcence from coming to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, than give any occaſion for the ſtirring of it. I conclude therefore from that, as well as the former arguments, that the evil principle ſpoken of by S. <hi>Paul</hi> cannot be evil habits, and conſequently nothing more left to us to demonſtrate, than that it is derived to us, from our Birth, or rather from our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in the Womb, which is all, that is affirmed concerning Original Corruption. Now that that evil principle, whereof we ſpeak, is derived to us from our Birth, will become at leaſt probable from what was before ſaid concerning the <hi>earlineſs</hi> of Men's being under ſin, yea their being ſo, as the Scripture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs us, even <hi>from their Youth.</hi> For as it is hard to believe, that all Men ſhould be ſo early under ſin, if it were not from ſome inward principle, that was antecedent to that Age (For what ſhould otherwiſe hinder ſome of them at leaſt from preſerving their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity for ſome time, eſpecially ſuppoſing, (as that tender Age maketh it reaſonable to ſuppoſe) a more peculiar watchfulneſs of the Divine Providence over it?) So it will be much more hard to believe, ſuppoſing that evil principle to be antecedent to their Youth, that it ſhould not be derived to them from their Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Birth: The Ages preceding that being not in a capacity to produce in themſelves ſuch an evil principle, and therefore to be ſuppos'd to have had it tranſmitted to them together with their Nature, and ſo alſo by the ſame means, and from the ſame time, in which that their Nature was. And indeed, as even the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt age falls under death, and not unreaſonably therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to be ſome way, or other under ſin, if (as S. <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 5.12.</note> ſpeaks) <hi>death enter'd by it, and ſo paſs'd upon all Men, for that all have ſinned;</hi> So there want not ſome places of Scripture, which do yet more directly evince, that the firſt beginnings of our Nature are tainted with that, of which we ſpeak. Of this ſort I reckon that of <hi>Job</hi>
                        <note n="(a)" place="margin">Job 14.4.</note>, which is ſo commonly apply'd to this affair, even his demanding of God, with reference to himſelf<note n="(b)" place="margin">Job 1, &amp;c.</note>, and all other Men, who could <hi>bring a clean thing out of an unclean?</hi> and thereby therefore inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating that it was not to be done. For as it is manifeſt from his alledging that the better to countenance his own expoſtulation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God's <hi>bringing him into judgment,</hi> tha by the unavoidable <hi>uncleanneſs</hi> there intimated muſt be meant a ſinful one, as which alone could either diſpoſe him to ſuch actions, as could be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per matter for judgment, or be alledged in bar to a ſevere one: So it is alike manifeſt from <hi>Job</hi>'s asking, <hi>who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean,</hi> that Men are not only ſo unclean in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but that they become ſo by thoſe evil principles, out of which they are <hi>brought,</hi> and ſo alſo from the time that they were ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from them.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56517:67"/>made<note n="(d)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> between a fleſhly, and ſpiritual temper, and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that is the moſt uſual notion of it in the New<note n="(e)" place="margin">Rom. 7.18, 25.

But of all the Texts of Scripture, which are commonly alledged in this affair (even the earlineſs of that evil principle, wherewith we have ſaid all Men to be imbued) there is certainly none of greater force, than the profeſſion, that <hi>David</hi> makes<note n="(f)" place="margin">Pſal. 51.5.</note>, that he was <hi>ſhapen,</hi> or born <hi>in iniquity,</hi> and <hi>conceiv'd by his Mother in ſin;</hi> That, if it entreat of the Corruption of humane Nature, making it as early as the firſt beginnings of it, becauſe ſpeaking as mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly of its Conception<note n="(g)" place="margin">Ham.

For what could be more ſutable to that, than to lay open, together with his actual ſins, that polluted Fountain from whence they came, and ſo ſhew himſelf to be vile upon more accounts, than one, and God to have as many reaſons to chaſtiſe him? And I ſhall only add, that as that ſenſe cannot therefore be fairly refus'd, becauſe conformable to the <hi>deſign</hi> of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> as well as to the <hi>letter</hi> of the Text it ſelf, and to the interpretation of the <hi>Antients,</hi> as well as either; So <hi>they</hi> ſeem to me to add no ſmall confirmation to it, who can find no other means to elude it, than by making the words of the ſame ſence with that <hi>hyperbolical</hi> expreſſion of the ſame Author, where he affirms<note n="(l)" place="margin">Pſal. 58.3.</note>, that <hi>the wicked are eſtranged from the Womb, and that as ſoon as they are born, they go aſtray ſpeaking lies.</hi> For as it cannot be deny'd that there is a very wide difference between Men's <hi>being conceived, and born in ſin,</hi> and their <hi>going aſtray from their Mother's Womb, and their own birth;</hi> This <hi>latter</hi> expreſſion importing that iniquity, which follows after it, whereas the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> denotes the condition of the Conception, and Birth it ſelf: So it is evident from what the Pſalmiſt adds in the place alledged concerning the wicked's <hi>ſpeaking lies,</hi> that he there entreats of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56517:67"/>
                        <hi>actual ſins,</hi> which as no Man denies to require a more mature Age for the perpetration of, ſo make it neceſſary to allow an <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbole</hi> in it; Whereas the place we inſiſt upon hath not the leaſt umbrage of actual ſins, and is therefore under no neceſſity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing interpreted conformably to it.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe it can hardly be imagin'd, but if there be ſuch a thing as Original ſin, it will produce ſutable effects in thoſe, in whom it is; And becauſe it can as little be thought, but that thoſe effects will lye open to the obſervation of all, that ſhall take the pains to reflect upon them; Therefore enquire we in the next place, whether that Original Sin, whereof we ſpeak, doth not diſcover it ſelf by <hi>ſutable effects,</hi> and ſo add yet farther ſtrength to what the Scripture hath affirm'd concerning it. A thing not to be doubted of, if we reflect upon the behaviour of Children, as ſoon as they come to have any uſe of reaſon. For do not ſome of thoſe, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks<note n="(m)" place="margin">Ibid.</note>, <hi>go aſtray from their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Womb, ſpeaking lies?</hi> Do not others diſcover in their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as much of malice, and revenge? Are not a third ſort as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory to the commands of their Superiours? Doth not a fourth equally pride it ſelf in all its ſuppoſed excellencies? Now from whence, I beſeech you, proceeds all this untowardneſs of behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, but from as untoward a principle, and ſuch a one too, as is interwoven with their very Being, and derived to them with it? For ſhall we ſay from the force of Example? But experience aſſures us of the contrary, becauſe viſible in ſuch Children, as have no ſuch examples before them, and who moreover do not want a ſevere education to prevent, or correct it. Shall we then ſay from ſome previous habits? But the ſame experience aſſures us of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, becauſe it is antecedent to any evil habits, and therefore not imputable to them. Shall we ſay laſtly (and more than that we cannot ſay) that it proceeds from their natural temperament? But as I no way doubt, and ſhall not therefore ſtick to confeſs, that the Corruption of our Nature runs out that way, which our natural temperament leads it; So I ſee no neceſſity to grant, that that natural temperament hath any other intereſt in our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towardneſs, than by inclining our natural Corruption to that <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> evil, to which we are carried. For to make it any other way the cauſe of that untowardneſs is to charge it upon God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he muſt be confeſs'd to be the Author of all that is purely natural in us. Only if it be ſaid, that that natural temperament may incline Children, before they have any free uſe of reaſon, to thoſe untowardneſſes, whereof we ſpeak, and ſo at length by the means of thoſe untowardneſſes produce ſuch an habitual inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them, that their more free reaſon, when they come to it, ſhall not be able to ſurmount it; I anſwer, that that indeed might well enough be granted, if we had no reaſon to believe, that God would ſo watch over them by his providence, as to hinder their natural temperament from having ſuch an influence upon them. But as we have reaſon enough to believe, from the love God bears to his own Workmanſhip, as well as to Piety, and Vertue, that he would not be wanting in that particular to the eſtate of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, if it were no other than ſuch as he himſelf had plac'd them
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56517:68"/>in; So we muſt therefore believe alſo, that that temperament of theirs is not the cauſe of their miſcarriages, but ſomewhat elſe that is not from God, and which, becauſe not from him, he doth not think himſelf under any neceſſity to provide againſt.</p>
                     <p>And indeed though ſome, who call themſelves Chriſtians, have notwithſtanding the former evidences, oppos'd themſelves againſt that, which we have offered as the Original cauſe thereof; Yet have the more ſober Heathen, though ignorant of the occaſion of it, both acknowledg'd, and lamented it, and ſo furniſh'd us with a farther argument for the belief of it. For thus (as Dr. <hi>Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
                        <note n="(n)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Coll.</hi> of his Works Book 10. Ch. 8.</note> did long ſince obſerve) we find one of them affirming that <hi>the nature of Man is prone to luſt,</hi> and another, that <hi>nature cannot ſeparate juſt from unjuſt.</hi> Thus a third (as the forementioned <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> remarks) that to <hi>Man of all the creatures is ſorrow given for a portion, to him luxury in innumerable faſhions, and in every Limb; To him alone ambition, and avarice, to him alone an unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable deſire of living;</hi> In fine, that <hi>whilſt it is given to other creatures, yea the moſt ſavage ones, to live peaceably, and orderly together, Man is naturally an enemy to thoſe of his own ſtock.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe are thoſe, which are quoted by <hi>Grotius</hi>
                        <note n="(o)" place="margin">De jure Becti ac. Pac. li. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>20.</hi> ſect. <hi>19.</hi> &amp; in Annot. intocum.</note>, if they are not alſo yet more worthy of our remark; Such as are, that <hi>among the other incommodities of mortal nature there is the darkneſs of Men's minds, and not only a neceſſity of erring, but a love of errours;</hi> That <hi>we have all ſinned, ſome in weightier inſtances, others in lighter, ſome of ſet purpoſe and deſign, others it may be carried away by other Men's wickedneſs;</hi> That <hi>we do not only offend, but we ſhall offend to the end of our lives, and although ſome one may have ſo purg'd his mind, that nothing ſhall any more diſturb, or deceive him, yet he comes to innocency by offending;</hi> That <hi>this evil diſpoſition is ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to Men, that, if every one be to be puniſhed, that hath it, no Man ſhall be free from puniſhment;</hi> That <hi>there is</hi> therefore <hi>a neceſſity</hi> upon thoſe, who are entruſted with the power of Chaſtiſement, <hi>to wink at ſome errours; He, who puniſheth Men, as if they could be free from all ſin, exceeding the meaſure of that correction, which is according to nature,</hi> or (as another hath expreſſed it) <hi>ſhewing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf injurious to the common infirmity of Men, and forgetful of that infirmity, which is humane, and univerſal.</hi> For as it is evident from theſe, and the like paſſages, that they, from whom they fell, had the ſame opinion of the State of Nature, which Chriſtianity obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth us to take up; So that opinion of theirs cannot but add to the confirmation of our own, and to the belief of that depravation, which it is the deſign of this Diſcourſe to evince: Becauſe not taken up either in whole, or in part from prejudices imbib'd from Books, but from the experience they had of its effects, and which as they themſelves could not but feel, and acknowledge, ſo we have no reaſon to queſtion, becauſe conſcious of the like effects of it in our ſelves.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. There being therefore no doubt to be made, but that there is ſuch a thing as Original Sin, becauſe ſufficiently atteſted by the Doctrine of the Scripture, and our own, and other Men's expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; It cannot but be thought reaſonable to enquire, <hi>from whence it had its beginning,</hi> and ſo much the rather becauſe both
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56517:68"/>Scripture, and reaſon aſſure us, that it cannot be thought to have had its Original from God. Now there are but four things, from whence it can be ſuppoſed to proceed, and within the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration whereof therefore this Enquiry of ours will neceſſarily be bounded; ſome evil <hi>Daemon,</hi> or <hi>Spirit,</hi> which concurrs with God to our production, or the <hi>natural pravity</hi> of that matter, which God makes uſe of in order to it; Some <hi>evil habits,</hi> which Souls contracted, before they were ſent into their preſent bodies, or ſome <hi>pravity in thoſe from whom they firſt deſcended,</hi> and which is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted from them to particular ſouls, and perſons. The <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe opinions is attended with this great inconvenience among many others, that it chargeth God either with malignity, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency; With malignity, if willingly ſuffering any evil ſpirit to mix it ſelf in his productions; With impotency, if not able to hinder it, though he would. The <hi>ſecond,</hi> as it is alike injurious to the power of God, becauſe ſubjecting that power of his to the indiſpoſition of the matter, ſo it makes Original Sin to be natural, and unavoidable, and conſequently alſo thoſe actual ſins, that ſlow from it. By which means it not only renders all our endeavours againſt them uſeleſs, but caſts a blemiſh upon thoſe divine Laws, which pretend to forbid them, and upon thoſe divine judgments, which pretend to puniſh them. For neither can God without great unreaſonableneſs forbid what is not to be avoided, nor pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it without the imputation of injuſtice. But it may be though Original Sin had not its beginning either from ſome evil ſpirit, or the <hi>pravity of the matter,</hi> which are the two firſt opinions, which pretend to give an account of it; yet it might, as is ſuggeſted in the <hi>third,</hi> ariſe from ſuch <hi>evil habits,</hi> as Men's ſouls contracted before their deſcent into this World, and into thoſe bodies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are inveſted. That indeed might yet more reaſonably be believ'd, that I ſay not alſo (abſtracting from the Authority of the Scripture) much more reaſonably, than the account, that is given of it from <hi>Adam,</hi> if there were but equal reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that Men's Souls had any ſeparate exiſtence antecedently to their conception in the Womb. But as that is a thing for which there is not any ſolid ground either in reaſon, or Scripture, and the ſuppoſition of it therefore the meer iſſue of fancy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture; So it is ſufficiently confuted by the ignorance Men's Souls are under of any ſuch previous eſtate. For why, if Men's Souls had any ſuch previous exiſtence, ſhould they not be conſcious of it, and of the things, that were performed by them in it? Nay, why ſhould not God take care to fix ſuch a remembrance in them, that ſo what was wanting in their former eſtate might be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd by them in their following one? For as it is not eaſie to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the corruptible body ſhould ſo far ſtupefie the Soul, as to hinder it from emerging in time out of ſleep, in which it may ſeem to have been caſt, and accordingly from calling to mind what had been before tranſacted within it; Becauſe though the Body may be ſome hindrance to the faculties of the Soul, yet it doth not hinder them from coming in time to exert their proper opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: So it is much leſs eaſie to ſuppoſe, that God ſhould not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever bring to it's memory its paſt State, and Actions, by which it
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56517:69"/>offended againſt him; Partly to make it ſenſible of its former guilt, and God's chooſing to puniſh it by thruſting it into a Body, and partly to make it ſo much the more careful to break off from thoſe ſins, by which it had before offended him; Theſe, as they are the only imaginable ends, why God ſhould thruſt an offending Soul into ſuch a Body, ſo being perfectly loſt to that Soul, in which there is no conſciouſneſs of it's former ſtate, and of thoſe enormities, which were contracted in it. I conclude therefore, that whatever may be ſaid as to this particular concerning Original Sin, yet it did not take its riſe from the evil acts, or habits of the Soul in any praexiſtent eſtate, and nothing therefore left to us to reſolve it into, but the <hi>depravedneſs of thoſe, from whom we all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended,</hi> and from whom it is tranſmitted to particular Souls, and Perſons.</p>
                     <p>I deny not indeed, that even this Account is not without its difficulties, and ſuch as it will be hard, if not impoſſible perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to aſſoile. I deny not farther, that thoſe difficulties are much enhanc'd by the ignorance we are under concerning the Original of humane Souls, and which whilſt we continue under, it will not be eaſie for us to ſhew, how that depravedneſs of Nature ſhould paſs from them to us. But as thoſe difficulties are no ways comparable to the difficulties of two of the former, even thoſe, which reſolve Original Sin into the malignity of ſome evil ſpirit, or the pravity of matter; So they can much leſs be thought to be of force againſt the teſtimony of the Scripture, if that (as I ſhall afterwards ſhew) favour its ariſing from the pravity of our firſt Parents: Partly becauſe the thing in queſtion is a matter of fact, and therefore to be determin'd rather by teſtimony, than the force of reaſon, and partly becauſe the teſtimony of Scripture is the moſt Authentick one, as being no other than the teſtimony of God. Now that there wants not ſufficient evidence from thence, that that Original Sin, whereof we ſpeak, ariſeth from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of thoſe, from whom we firſt deſcended, will appear if theſe three things can be made out; Firſt, that the ſin of all mankind enter'd in by <hi>Adam;</hi> Secondly, that it enter'd in by <hi>Adam</hi> not meerly as the firſt that committed it, or tempted other Men by his ill example to do the like, but as more, or leſs the cauſe of all their ſins by his own; Thirdly that he became the cauſe of all their ſins through his, by depraving thereby his own Nature, and then communicating that depravation to thoſe, that deſcended from him.</p>
                     <p>That the Sin of all Mankind enter'd in by <hi>Adam,</hi> will need no other proof, than that known Text of S. <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <note n="(p)" place="margin">Rom. 5.12.</note>, even that <hi>by one Man ſin enter'd into the World, and death by ſin, and ſo death paſſed through unto all Men, for that all have ſinned.</hi> For as we cannot well interpret the word <hi>ſin</hi> of any other, than the ſin of all Men, becauſe there is nothing in the Text to limit it to any particular Man's, ſo much leſs, when S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth afterwards affirm, that that <hi>death,</hi> which enter'd in by it, paſſed thorough un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Men, <hi>for that,</hi> or becauſe <hi>all had ſinned</hi> by the means of him; That as it makes death to paſs upon all Men with reſpect to their ſeveral ſins, and conſequently their ſeveral ſins to be the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56517:69"/>immediate door by which it enters, ſo making thoſe ſeveral ſins therefore to be included in that ſin, which he before affirmed to be the cauſe of that death, and, together with it, to have enter'd in by <hi>Adam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But becauſe among thoſe at leaſt, by whom the Scripture is acknowledg'd, the queſtion is not ſo much, whether all ſin enter'd by <hi>Adam,</hi> but after what manner it enter'd by him; And becauſe, till that be known, we cannot ſpeak with any certainty concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the derivation of the corruptneſs of our Natures from that of our firſt Parents or Parent; Therefore paſs we on to ſhew, according to the method before laid down, that as the ſin of all Mankind enter'd in <hi>by Adam,</hi> ſo it enter'd in by him, not (as ſome have vainly deem'd) meerly as one, who firſt committed it, or tempted others by his example to do the like, but as one alſo, yea eſpecially, who by the malignant influence of his ſin was more or leſs the cauſe of all thoſe ſins, that followed it. That the ſin of all Mankind enter'd not in by <hi>Adam</hi> either meerly, or principally as one, who firſt committed it, will need no other proof than his being not the firſt committer of ſin even in this ſublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary World, but that <hi>Serpent,</hi> who tempted our firſt Parents to it. For as he, and his fellow Angels ſinned before them in thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſeats, in which they were firſt beſtow'd; So he ſinned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo before them here by that temptation, which he ſuggeſted to them, and without which they had not fallen from their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity. Which as it is an evidence of ſin's not entring in by <hi>Adam</hi> in that ſenſe, and conſequently that that was not the ſenſe intended by S. <hi>Paul;</hi> So is the more to be conſidered, becauſe S. <hi>John</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes this entrance of ſin to the <hi>Devil</hi>
                        <note n="(q)" place="margin">1. Joh. 3.8.</note>, yea makes all the committers of ſin to be therefore <hi>of him.</hi> But beſides that <hi>Adam</hi> was not the firſt of thoſe that ſinned, and we therefore not ſo to underſtand S. <hi>Paul,</hi> when deſcribing ſin as entring by him; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was he the firſt of humane kind that ſinned, which will be a yet farther prejudice to the former ſurmiſe. For (as we learn from the ſtory of the Fall<note n="(r)" place="margin">Gen. 3.6.</note>, yea from this very Apoſtle elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where)<note n="(ſ)" place="margin">1 Tim. 2.14.</note> 
                        <hi>Adam was not deceiv'd,</hi> that is to ſay, was not the firſt that was ſo, <hi>but the Woman being deceiv'd was in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.</hi> Which what is it but to ſay, that ſin did not enter in by <hi>Adam</hi> in that ſenſe, and conſequently that that was not the ſenſe intended by the Apoſtle in it? Only if it be ſaid (and more than that cannot be ſaid in it) that we are not ſo to underſtand S. <hi>Paul,</hi> when deſcribing ſin as entring by <hi>Adam,</hi> as not alſo to ſuppoſe him to connote the Partner both of his Bed, and of his tranſgreſſion; As I will not be forward to deny the ſuggeſtion altogether, becauſe believing them both to have contributed to the production of our tranſgreſſions, as well as Nature, ſo I cannot forbear to ſay upon the account of that which follows, that we ought to conſider <hi>Adam</hi> as the more eſpecial inſtrument in it. Becauſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> not only repreſents him<note n="(t)" place="margin">Rom. 5.14.</note> in particular as the Type, or Figure of him, that was to come, but both deſcribes him all along under the notion of <hi>one Man</hi>
                        <note n="(u)" place="margin">Rom. 12.15, 16. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note>, yea makes a great part of the likeneſs, that was between him and Chriſt to conſiſt in it. Which could by no means have been proper, if he had meant no other by ſin's
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56517:70"/>entring in by <hi>Adam,</hi> than entring in by him as one of the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitters of it. For in this ſenſe <hi>Eve</hi> muſt neceſſarily have had the preeminence, becauſe not only offending before her Husband, but tempting even him to do the ſame. From that firſt ſenſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore paſs we to the ſecond, and which indeed is both more anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and plauſible, than the former. For as it is as old as that <hi>Pelagius</hi>
                        <note n="(w)" place="margin">Vid. Voſſ. Hiſt. Pelag. li. <hi>2.</hi> parte <hi>2. Theſ. 1.</hi>
                        </note>, who firſt call'd Original Sin in queſtion, ſo it allows the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> to have had an influence upon other Men's ſins, as well as to have given beginning to the being of it. But that it hath as little ſolidity, or pertinency to the words, whereunto it is apply'd, will appear if we reflect upon the ſequel of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, or the ſubject matter of that, which is offered as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of it. For is there any reaſon to think (without which that interpretation can be of no avail) that <hi>Adam</hi> by his ſin tempted all his poſterity to offend? Nay, is there not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon enough to believe, that that example of his contributed little to Men's following ſins, yea contributed nothing at all to many of them? For how many Men have there been, to whom the knowledge of his ſin never reach'd? How many are there yet, who are under the ſame ignorance, or may hereafter be? And muſt not theſe therefore be look'd upon as exempted from the influence of his ill example, and conſequently, if their ſins entred in by <hi>Adam,</hi> be acknowledg'd to have entred ſome other way? And though the ſame be not to be ſaid of thoſe, to whom the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures have come, becauſe thoſe are not without the knowledge of his ſin, nor incapable of being influenc'd by his example; Yet is there as little reaſon to think, that that example of his contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes much to their ſins, or indeed ever did to theirs, who lived nearer to him, and ſo were more likely to have been inflicted by him. For beſide that a ſin ſo chaſtis'd, as that was, was not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry likely to draw their thoughts towards it, and therefore as little likely to tempt them to the imitation of it; Beſide that many of them might have no actual conſideration of it, as no doubt many now have not, even when they offend in the like kind; They might have been influenc'd, and no doubt were by other ſins of his, as much, or more than by his firſt tranſgreſſion, or by the ill examples of thoſe, that were nearer to them, rather than by any of his. In fine they might have been, and no doubt often were influenced by the baits of pleaſure, or profit, and thereby drawn aſide from their integrity; Theſe having been as apt to influence them, as the example of that ſin, by which their ſeveral offences are ſuppos'd to have entred into the World. And I ſhall only add, that as that ſenſe cannot therefore be reaſonably impos'd, if we regard, as no doubt we ought, the ſubject matter of it; So we ſhall find as little encouragement for it from the ſequel of his Diſcourſe, whoſe words are now under conſideration. For beſide that he himſelf may ſeem ſufficiently to obviate it by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming preſently after<note n="(x)" place="margin">Rom. 5.14.</note>, that there were many of thoſe, that ſinned, that did not, nor well could ſin <hi>after the ſimilitude of</hi> Adam's <hi>tranſgreſſion,</hi> becauſe knowing nothing at all of any ſuch poſitive law, as he tranſgreſs'd; It is the main deſign of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to compare the good, that Chriſt brought by his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56517:70"/>with the hurt which that type of his did by his tranſgreſſion. Which compariſon had been but a <hi>frigid</hi> one, if all the hurt, that <hi>Adam</hi> did us, was by the force of his ill example: Becauſe it is certain that Chriſt's obedience was of a much more efficacious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence in the kind of it, as well as in the degree, and would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rather have been vilified, than any way illuſtrated, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the compariſon, if the malign influence of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin had reach'd no farther, than that of an example. I conclude therefore, that what ever was meant by ſin's entring in by <hi>Adam,</hi> yet ſomething more was meant by it, than its entring by him either as the firſt committer of it, or as one, who by his ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample tempted others to do the like. And indeed as the inſtance but now alledg'd, even the likeneſs, that is between <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, and Chriſt's obedience, makes it but reaſonable to look upon all ſin as entring alſo by <hi>Adam,</hi> as more, or leſs the cauſe of it, ſo it ſtands yet more confirm'd by what S. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms in the ninteenth verſe, eſpecially as it lies in the <hi>Original:</hi> The purport thereof being, that Men are <hi>conſtituted</hi> ſinners by his diſobedience, yea that they are ſo <hi>conſtituted</hi> ſinners by it, as Men are conſtituted righteous by the obedience of Chriſt. For though the words <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <note n="(y)" place="margin">Rom. 5.18, 19.</note> as the reaſon of their condemnation by it, and ought therefore to be diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from it; And partly becauſe they are ſaid to be conſtituted ſinners by <hi>Adam</hi>'s diſobedience, as they, who belong to Chriſt, are conſtituted righteous by his obedience. For the obedience of Chriſt procuring Men's being really righteous, as well as their being reputed ſuch, yea procuring their being really righteous in ſome meaſure, that they may be ſo accounted of, and us'd; What can be more reaſonable than to think, that that diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>Adam,</hi> which is affirmed to be like it, is of the ſame <hi>cauſality,</hi> and accordingly conſtitutes, or makes Men ſinners, as well as accounted of as ſuch.</p>
                     <p>One only thing remains towards the clearing of the matter in hand, even the derivation of the corruptneſs of our Nature from that of our firſt Parent, or Parents; And that is, that as all ſin entred in by <hi>Adam</hi> as more, or leſs the cauſe of it by his own, ſo he became the cauſe of it by his own by thereby depraving his own Nature firſt, and then communicating that depravation to thoſe, that deſcended from him. Of the former whereof as there cannot well be any doubt, conſidering the hainouſneſs of that ſin, which he committed (That as it could not but occaſion the withdrawing of the Divine Grace from <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo neither but draw after it the depravation of his Nature, as which receiv'd all its rectitude from the other) ſo there will be as little doubt of the latter, if we compare what S. <hi>Paul</hi> here ſaith concerning <hi>Adam</hi>'s being the cauſe of all our ſins by his own, with what he
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56517:71"/>afterward ſaith<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 7.17-20.</note> concerning Men's falling into actual ſin by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of an <hi>evil principle,</hi> that <hi>dwelleth</hi> in them.

                     <p n="5">V. I may not diſmiſs the Argument that is now before us, or indeed ſo much as attend to the conſideration of thoſe <hi>Objections,</hi> that are made againſt it, before I have alſo enquir'd, <hi>whether that, which hath the name of</hi> Original Sin, <hi>be truly, and properly ſuch,</hi> and not rather ſo ſtiled in reſpect of that <hi>firſt ſin,</hi> from which it proceeded, or in reſpect of <hi>thoſe ſins,</hi> to which it leads. For beſide that that <hi>Church,</hi> whoſe <hi>Catechiſm</hi> I have choſen to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, leads us to the conſideration of it, becauſe both there, and elſewhere<note n="(c)" place="margin">Art. of Relig. 6.</note> affirming it to have the <hi>nature</hi> of a Sin, to make us the <hi>Children of Wrath,</hi> and to <hi>deſerve God's Wrath and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;</hi> The reſolution of it is of no ſmall moment toward the right ſtating of our duty, and the valuableneſs of that remedy, which Chriſtianity hath provided for it. For neither otherwiſe can we look upon Original Sin as any proper matter for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, whatſoever it may be for our lamentation, nor upon Baptiſm as bringing any other pardon to Infants, than that of the Sin of their firſt Parents, and which they who look upon Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sin as rather our unhappineſs, than fault, are generally as far from charging them with. This only would be premis'd for the better underſtanding of it, that by <hi>Sin</hi> is not meant any actual tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of a Law (for no Man was ever ſo abſurd, as to affirm that concerning Original Sin) but that which is contrary to a Law in the nature of an <hi>evil habit,</hi> and both imports an abſence of that Righteouſneſs, which ought to be in us, and an inclination to thoſe evils, from which we ought to be averſe; This, as it is no leſs the tranſgreſſion of a Law, than any actual ſin is, ſo making the perſon, in whom it is, as obnoxious to puniſhment, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to be look'd upon as yet more properly a ſin. Now that that, which we call Original Sin, is really ſuch in this latter no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will appear if theſe two things be conſidered; Firſt, that the Scripture gives it the title of ſin, Secondly, that it repreſents it as ſuch upon the account of our being obliged by the Law of God to have in us a contrary temper. That the Scripture gives that, whereof we ſpeak, the title of ſin, is evident from thoſe Texts, which we before made uſe of to prove the being of it; More particularly from that<note n="(d)" place="margin">Pſa. 91.5.</note>, which repreſents <hi>David</hi> as <hi>conceiv'd, and born in ſin,</hi> and thoſe<note n="(e)" place="margin">Rom. 7.17-20.</note>, which repreſent us all as having <hi>ſin dwelling in us.</hi> For theſe having been before ſhewn to ſpeak of Original Sin make it evident that the Scripture gives it the title of <hi>Sin,</hi> becauſe in the former places repreſenting it under that notion. And though I will not from that only <hi>Topick</hi> conclude it to be properly ſuch, becauſe the Scripture makes uſe of figurative expreſſions, as well as proper, yea doth ſo in this very particular whereof we ſpeak (for thus it ſometimes gives the title of <hi>ſin</hi> to that, which is intended only as the puniſhment thereof) yet as
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56517:72"/>we may lawfully inferr from thence, that there is more cauſe to believe Original Sin to be <hi>properly,</hi> than <hi>figuratively</hi> ſuch, till the contrary thereof be made appear, The proper ſenſe being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be preferr'd before the figurative; So that there can be no place for the <hi>figurative</hi> ſenſe, if that, which is there repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a <hi>ſin,</hi> be elſewhere repreſented as ſuch upon the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our being obliged to have in us the contrary temper. Which that it is will appear from ſuch Texts, as do more immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm it, or ſuch as affirm thoſe things, from which it may by good conſequence be deduced. Of the former ſort I reckon that, which is immediately ſubjoyn'd by <hi>David</hi> to the mention of his being <hi>conceiv'd in ſin, and brought forth in iniquity</hi>
                        <note n="(f)" place="margin">Pſa. 51 6.</note>. <hi>Behold thou requireſt truth in the inward parts, and ſhalt,</hi> or rather haſt <hi>made me to underſtand wiſdom ſecretly.</hi> For as we cannot but look upon what is there ſaid concerning God's <hi>requiring truth in the inward parts</hi> as ſpoken with relation to that <hi>ſin,</hi> whereof he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore complains, and to the mention whereof he ſubjoyns the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the other; So neither (conſidering it to have been his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to aggravate his ſinfulneſs before God) but look upon it as alſo his intent to aggravate the ſinfulneſs of his frame by that piety which God required of him. Which ſuppos'd, Original Sin will not only be found to be ſo entituled by the Scripture, but to have had that name beſtowed upon it upon the account of Men's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to the contrary, and conſequently to be truely and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſuch. And though there be not it may be many more Texts of <hi>that nature,</hi> or which therefore can be thought ſo directly to affirm, that it becometh the ſin of thoſe, in whom it is, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of their obligation to the contrary; Yet will it not be difficult to find others, which do as clearly aſſert thoſe things, from which it may by good conſequence be deduced. Such as are thoſe which make Original Sin to be a proper matter for <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi> yea to induce a guilt upon the perſon, in whom it is. But ſo the Prophet <hi>David</hi> doth plainly ſuppoſe in that very Pſalm, which we but now made uſe of; Becauſe not only <hi>confeſſing</hi>
                        <note n="(g)" place="margin">Pſa. 51.5.</note> the ſinfulneſs of his <hi>Nature</hi> together with that of his external a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, but begging of God, immediately after that confeſſion of his, that he would <hi>purge him</hi>

                        <hi>with Hyſſop from it.</hi> For as we have no reaſon to exclude that from the matter of the deſir'd pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, which immediately precedes the Prayer that is put up for it; So much leſs reaſon to doubt, after that Prayer for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of it, of its inducing a guilt upon the perſon, in whom it is: The uſe of <hi>Hyſſop</hi> in the Old Law (as appears by ſeveral places<note n="(i)" place="margin">Exo. 12.22.

                        </note>) being to ſprinkle the Blood of the Sacrifices upon thoſe, who were any way obnoxious to its cenſures, and ſo deliver them from the ſeverity thereof. For what other then could the Pſalmiſt mean by that Prayer of his, than that God would purge him from that, and his other ſins by the blood of an expiatory Sacrifice? Or ſo meaning be thought to intimate more clearly, than that that, from which he deſir'd to be purg'd, ſtood in need of ſuch a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and conſequently was no more without its guilt, than his actual tranſgreſſions were. Only, if that notion may not be
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56517:72"/>thought to be of ſufficient clearneſs to build ſo important a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion on, it will not be difficult to ſtrengthen it yet more by the <hi>word</hi> the <hi>Hebrew</hi> makes us of for <hi>purge,</hi> and thoſe Prayers, which the Pſalmiſt ſubjoyneth to it; By the former becauſe literally<note n="(l)" place="margin">

                     <p n="6">VI. Now though from what hath been ſaid it be competently evident, that the Doctrine of Original Sin is not without good Authority to warrant it, yet becauſe that Doctrine hath been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned by the <hi>Pelagians</hi> of Old, and ſince that by the followers of <hi>Socinus,</hi> therefore it may not be amiſs for the farther clearing of it to conſider their Objections againſt it, and either return a direct, and ſatisfactory anſwer to them, or at leaſt ſhew, that they ought not however to be admitted as a bar againſt what the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture hath ſaid concerning it. To begin with thoſe Objections which reſpect the being of it, or rather tend to ſhew that it hath no being in the World; Which are either ſuch, as conſider it as a <hi>ſimple corruption</hi> of humane Nature, or ſuch as do alſo conſider it as a <hi>ſinful</hi> one. Of the former ſort are thoſe, which repreſent it as a thing unconceivable, how it ſhould come into humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which the better to perſuade, they alledge plauſible reaſons againſt all thoſe means, whereby it may be ſuppos'd to find ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance. For theſe being deſtroy'd, they think they may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully inferr, that there is indeed no ſuch depravation upon humane Nature. Of what force thoſe reaſons are will be then more ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to enquire, when I conſider what is objected againſt the fountain of Original Corruption, or the means by which it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd. At preſent it may ſuffice to ſay, that of what force ſoever they may be thought to be, yet they are not of ſufficient force to deſtroy the being of Original Corruption, which is the thing for which they are here alledg'd; Partly, becauſe many things may be, yea be aſſur'd to us, of the original, or conveyance whereof we our ſelves are perfectly ignorant (for who doubts of the being of humane Souls, though he neither knows, nor well can, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be traduc'd, or infus'd) and partly becauſe the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Scripture, with the experience we have of its effects, is a much more forcible argument of the being of it, than all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reaſons are of the other: Theſe being direct, and immediate proofs of its exiſtence, whereas the other are only indirect, and mediate. From ſuch objections therefore as conſider Original Sin as a ſimple Corruption of humane Nature, paſs we to thoſe, which conſider it alſo as <hi>ſinful,</hi> and which indeed ſeem moſt hardly to preſs upon it: Such as are, that all ſin is the tranſgreſſion of a
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56517:73"/>Law, which Original Sin ſeems not to be; That it requires the conſent of the will of him, in whom it is, which cannot well be affirm'd of that; As in fine, that the Scripture it ſelf may ſeem to make that, which we call Original Sin, rather the <hi>Parent</hi> of Sin, than ſin it ſelf, becauſe making ſin to ariſe<note n="(o)" place="margin">James 1.13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> from the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,</hi> and <hi>parturition</hi> of it. As to what is objected from the forementioned Scripture, it is either nothing at all to the purpoſe, or very much againſt the purpoſe of thoſe, that alledge it: Partly becauſe by the <hi>ſin</hi> there ſpoken of can be meant no other, than <hi>actual</hi> ſin, and nothing therefore to be concluded from thence, but that all actual ſin is the product of Men's <hi>Luſt,</hi> and partly becauſe that <hi>Text</hi> makes even actual ſins to be the product of Men's <hi>Luſt,</hi> yea of ſuch a luſt as <hi>draweth them aſide,</hi> and <hi>enticeth</hi> them. For who can well think the Parent of ſuch Children to be of a better Nature, than the Children themſelves, eſpecially when ſhe is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed as giving birth to them by falſe, and deceitful Arts? Such Arts as thoſe reflecting no great honour upon the Mother, but on the contrary making her to be altogether as criminal, as the other. If therefore they, who impugn Original Sin as ſuch, would do it with any advantage, it muſt not be by Arguments drawn from Scripture, which will rather hurt, than profit them, but by Arguments drawn from reaſon, and particularly by ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent Original Sin as no tranſgreſſion of a Law, and therefore no ſin properly ſo call'd, or as a thing which hath not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the will of him, in whom it is, and therefore yet farther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from it. As concerning the former of theſe, even that which repreſents Original Sin as no tranſgreſſion of a Law, I anſwer that they, who ſo ſpeak, muſt deny it to be ſuch, either becauſe it is no Act, or becauſe there is no Law, which it can be ſuppos'd to be a tranſgreſſion of. If the former of theſe be their meaning, I willingly grant what they alledge, but I ſay withall, that it will not from thence follow, that it is no ſin at all. For if Men are obliged by the divine Law to a pious, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent temper, as well as not to ſwerve from it in their actions, the want of that happy temper, or the having a contrary one will be as much the tranſgreſſion of a Law, as the want of the ſame piety in their actions. Which will conſequently devolve the whole force of that Objection upon the ſuppoſition of there being no ſuch Law of God, which requires the former temper, or which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Original Sin can be thought to be a tranſgreſſion of. But as I have already made it appear in ſome meaſure, that there is in truth ſuch a Law, as requires a pious, and innocent temper, ſo I ſhall now endeavour to ſtrengthen it by ſome more particular proofs, and by anſwering thoſe exceptions, that are made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
                     <p>In order to the former whereof we are to know, that as the <hi>Law</hi> we ſpeak of muſt be ſuppoſed to have been given to <hi>Adam,</hi> as that too not only in his <hi>private,</hi> but <hi>publick</hi> capacity, and as he may be thought to have been the <hi>repreſentative</hi> of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind (there being no other Law, which can be ſuppos'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us, before we come to be in a capacity to apprehend, and obey it) ſo I ſhall endeavour to make it appear firſt, that there
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56517:73"/>was ſuch a Law given to <hi>Adam,</hi> and then that it was given to him not only in his <hi>private,</hi> but <hi>publick</hi> capacity, and as he may be thought to have been the <hi>repreſentative</hi> of all Mankind. Now that there was a Law given to <hi>Adam,</hi> requiring a pious, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent temper, as well as the preſerving that piety and innocency in his actions, will need no other proof than God's creating him in it, and the love he may be ſuppoſed to bear unto it. For as we cannot think God would have ever intruſted ſuch a Jewel with <hi>Adam,</hi> if it had not been his intention that he ſhould preſerve, and exerciſe it; ſo much leſs, when the <hi>holineſs</hi> of the <hi>divine Nature</hi> perſuades his love to it, as well as the declarations of his word. For what were this, but to make God indifferent, what became of his moſt excellent gifts, which no wiſe perſon, and much leſs ſo hearty a lover of them can be ſuppoſed to be? If therefore there can be any doubt concerning the <hi>Law</hi> we ſpeak of, it muſt be as to its having been given to <hi>Adam</hi> in his <hi>publick</hi> capacity, and as he may be ſuppos'd to have been the <hi>repreſentative</hi> of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Which I ſhall endeavour to evince firſt by ſhewing what I mean by his <hi>publick</hi> capacity, ſecondly by ſhewing that <hi>Adam</hi> was ſet in ſuch a capacity, and thirdly that the Law we ſpeak of was given to him as conſidered in it. By the <hi>publick</hi> capacity of <hi>Adam</hi> I mean ſuch a one, whereby as he was deſign'd to be the Father of all Mankind, ſo God made him a kind of Truſtee for it; In order thereunto both giving him what he did for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, as well as his own, and obliging him for their ſakes, as well as his own, to ſee to the preſervation of it, and act agreeably to it. Which if he did, his Poſterity as well as himſelf ſhould have the benefit thereof, and God's favour together with it, but if not, forfeit together with him what God had ſo beſtow'd upon him, and incurr the penalty of his diſpleaſure. Now that <hi>Adam</hi> was ſet in ſuch a capacity (which is the ſecond thing to be demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) will appear from the Scriptures making him the cauſe of all Men's death by his offence, and diſobedience. For the effects of another diſobedience being not otherwiſe chargeable upon any Man, than as that other may be ſuppos'd to be appointed to act for him; If the effects of <hi>Adam</hi>'s diſobedience were to fall upon all his Poſterity, he alſo muſt be ſuppoſed to have been appointed to act for them, and conſequently to have been ſet in that <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> capacity, whereof I ſpeak. Which will leave nothing more for us to ſhew upon this Head, than that that Law, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a pious and innocent temper was given to <hi>Adam</hi> in that capacity. But as we can as little doubt of that, if his contracting a contrary temper was as fatal to his Poſterity, as to himſelf; So that it was, will need no other proof than his producing the like temper in them, and that temper's proving as deadly to them. The former whereof is evident from what I before ſaid to ſhew, that <hi>Original Sin</hi> had its beginning from <hi>Adam,</hi> the latter from S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s<note n="(p)" place="margin">Rom. 7.24.</note> calling it a <hi>Body of Death,</hi> or a Body that brings it: The <hi>Genitive Caſe</hi>
                        <note n="(q)" place="margin">Grot. in loc.</note> among the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and <hi>Helleniſts,</hi> being uſually ſet for ſuch <hi>Adjectives,</hi> as betoken a cauſality in them; Even as the <hi>Savour of Death</hi> is us'd for a <hi>deadly</hi> one, or that which
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56517:74"/>bringeth death, and the <hi>Tree of Life</hi> for a <hi>life-giving</hi> one, or that which was apt to produce, or continue it.</p>
                     <p>I deny not indeed (that I may now paſs to thoſe Exceptions that are commonly made againſt it) that it may ſeem hard to conceive how <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould be ſet in ſuch a <hi>capacity,</hi> as to involve all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in happineſs, or miſery, according as he either continued in, or fell from that integrity, wherein God created him. I deny not therefore, but that it is equally hard to conceive how God ſhould give him ſuch a <hi>Law,</hi> the obſervation, or tranſgreſſion whereof on his part ſhould redound to the account of his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. But as every thing, that is hard to be conceiv'd, is not therefore to be deny'd, if it be otherwiſe ſtrengthen'd with ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient proofs; So it would be conſider'd alſo, whether it be not much more hard to conceive, how God ſhould otherwiſe involve Infants, and Children in thoſe calamities, into which they often fall, eſpecially in National Judgments: It being certainly more agreeable to the divine Juſtice, to conceive thoſe to have ſome way, or other offended, and conſequently thereto to have fallen under the diſpleaſure of it, than to conceive them to ſuffer it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any offence at all. For why then ſhould we not think, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the Scripture hath led the way, that God oblig'd them in <hi>Adam</hi> to a pious, and innocent temper, and which they loſing in him, they became obnoxious with him to the ſame ſad effects of his diſpleaſure? And though it be true, that there is this great imparity between the caſes, that the effect of God's diſpleaſure upon occaſion of <hi>Original Sin</hi> is made to reach to eternal miſery, as well as to a temporal one, whereas the caſe we before inſtanc'd in concerns only a temporal puniſhment: Yet as they do thus far agree, that a puniſhment is inflicted, where there is no actual ſin to deſerve it, which is ſufficiently irreconcileable with the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding we otherwiſe have of the divine Juſtice; So that great imparity may be much abated by conſidering, that God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a Plaſter as large as the Sore, (even by giving his Son to dye for all Mankind) and appointed the Sacrament of Baptiſm to convey the benefit of it. For as the conſequents of Original Sin will be thereby taken off from ſo many Infants at leaſt, as are admitted to that Sacrament, ſo that mercy of his to thoſe, and the aſſurance we have from the Scripture of his giving his Son to dye for all may perſwade us to believe, that though he hath not reveal'd the particular way to us, yet he hath ſome other way to convey the benefit of that death to thoſe, who are not admitted to the other.</p>
                     <p>But it will be ſaid it may be (which is a no leſs prejudice againſt the being of Original Sin) that all ſin, to make it truly ſuch, muſt have the conſent of the will of thoſe, in whom it is, as well as be the tranſgreſſion of a Law. A thing by no means to be affirm'd concerning that, which we call Original Sin, becauſe not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted before we had a being, and therefore alſo before we had ſo much as the <hi>faculty</hi> of <hi>willing,</hi> but moreover conveyed to us, when we had neither reaſon to apprehend it, nor any power in our <hi>wills</hi> either to admit, or reject it. And indeed how altogether to take
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56517:74"/>off the force of that Objection is beyond my capacity to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, or ſatisfie the underſtandings of other Men: Becauſe as I cannot ſee how any thing can be a ſin, which hath not alſo the conſent of the will of thoſe, in whom it is, ſo I am as little able to conceive how Original Sin ſhould have the conſent of ours, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when it was firſt contracted, or when it was tranſmitted to us. But as I am far leſs able to conceive how Infants, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould come to be ſo ſeverely dealt with without any offence at all, or therefore without having ſome way, or other conſented to one; So I think firſt, that that difficulty may well be laid in the ballance againſt the other, yea alledged as a bar to the ſuppoſed force of it. For why ſhould my inability to apprehend how Infants, and Children could conſent to Original Sin, prevail with me to deny the being of it, when a far greater inability to apprehend how the ſame perſons ſhould come to be ſo ſeverely dealt withal without it, doth not prevail with me to deny that ſevere uſage of them? Neither will it avail to ſay (which is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe conſiderable enough) that we have for the belief of this laſt the teſtimony of our Senſes, which is not to be alledged as to the other. For the queſtion is not now whether the ſevere uſage of Infants, and Children may not more reaſonably be believ'd, than their Original Sin, upon the account of the greater evidence there may be of it; But whether we can any more deny the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin of Infants, and Children upon the account of our inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to apprehend, how they ſhould conſent unto it, than we can deny the ſevere uſage of the ſame perſons upon the account of our inability to apprehend, how they ſhould come to be ſo dealt with without the other. Which that we cannot is evident from hence, that we are equally at a loſs in our apprehenſions about the one, and the other, that I ſay not alſo more at a loſs about the latter, than about the former. And indeed, as we find it neceſſary to believe many things notwithſtanding our inability to apprehend how they ſhould come to paſs, and ought not therefore to deny the being of any one thing upon the ſole account of that inabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; So our apprehenſions are ſo ſhort as to the modes of thoſe things, of the being whereof we are moſt aſſured, that it will hardly be deemed reaſonable to inſiſt upon the ſuggeſtions of them, againſt the affirmations of the Scripture: Partly becauſe of the Authority of him, from whom it proceeded, and partly becauſe we cannot ſo eaſily fail in our apprehenſion concerning the due ſenſe of the affirmations of it, as in the deductions of our own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon concerning the things affirmed; Nothing more being required to the underſtanding of the one, than a due conſideration of the ſignification of the words, wherein they are expreſſed; whereas to the right ordering of the other, there is requir'd a due under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Nature of thoſe things about which we reaſon, which is both a matter of far greater difficulty, and in many caſes impoſſible to be attain'd. Whatever difficulty therefore there may be in apprehending how Original Sin could have the conſent of thoſe, in whom it is ſuppoſed to be, and conſequently how it ſhould be truly and properly a ſin; Yet ought not that to be a bar againſt our belief of it, if the Scripture hath repreſented it as ſuch, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56517:75"/>which whether it hath, or no, I ſhall leave to be judg'd by what I have before obſerv'd from it.</p>
                     <p>From ſuch Objections, as are level'd more immediately againſt the <hi>being</hi> of Original Sin, paſs we to thoſe which impugne the derivation of it from <hi>Adam,</hi> and from whom we have affirmed it to proceed. Which Objections again do either tend to ſhew, that it had its Original from ſomething elſe, or that it cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to have its Original from <hi>Adam.</hi> An opinion hath prevail'd of late years, that that, which we call Original Sin, took its riſe from the ſins of particular Souls in ſome <hi>praexiſtent</hi> eſtate, and from thoſe <hi>evil habits,</hi> which they contracted by them. And certainly the opinion were reaſonable enough to be embrac'd, if the <hi>praeex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence</hi> of Souls were but as well prov'd, as it is ſpeciouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd. For, that ſuppos'd, it would be no hard matter to give an account of the riſe of that Corruption, which is in us, nor yet of God's afflicting thoſe on whom no other blame appears: That corruption, as it is no other than what particular Souls have them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves contracted, ſo making them as obnoxious to the vengeance of God, as any after ſins can be ſuppoſed to do. But do they, who advance this <hi>hypotheſis,</hi> think the plauſibleneſs thereof a ſufficient ground to build it on? Or are <hi>problems</hi> in <hi>Divinity</hi> no other way to be determin'd, than thoſe of <hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> or other ſuch <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural</hi> Arts are? I had thought that for the reſolution of theſe we ought rather to have had recourſe to that <hi>word</hi> of God, which was deſign'd to give us an underſtanding of them, to have examin'd the ſeveral aſſertions of it, and acquieſced in them, how difficult ſoever to be apprehended. I had thought that we ought to have done ſo much more, where the Scripture profeſſeth to deliver its opinion, and doth not only not wave the thing in queſtion, but ſpeaks to it. Which that it doth in the preſent caſe will need no other proof than the account it gives of the Original of Mankind, and then of the Original of Evil. For as it profeſſeth to ſpeak of <hi>Adam</hi> not only as created by God, but as appointed by him<note n="(r)" place="margin">Gen. 1.28.</note> to give being by the way of natural Generation to all, that after him ſhould repleniſh the Earth (which how he ſhould be thought to do, if he were only to be a means of furniſhing them with a Body, who had the <hi>better</hi> part of their being before, is paſt my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to imagine) ſo it profeſſeth to ſpeak of the ſame <hi>Adam</hi> as one by whom <hi>ſin,</hi> and <hi>death</hi>
                        <note n="(ſ)" place="margin">Rom. 5.12. 1 Cor. 15.21, 22.</note> enter'd into the World, as well as the perſons of thoſe, on whom it ſeizeth. And can there then be any place for a precarious <hi>hypotheſis</hi> about the Original of Mankind, or the evils of it? Can there be place for advancing that <hi>hypotheſis</hi> not only beſide, but againſt the determinations of the Scripture? Do not all ſuch <hi>hypotheſes</hi> proceed upon the <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> of the matter, about which they are converſant? Do they not come in as a relief to the underſtandings of Men, where they cannot be ſatisfied any other way? But how then can there be place for ſuch a one, where the Scripture hath determin'd? How can there be any place even for the moſt ſpecious, and plauſible? For as that cannot be ſuppos'd to be <hi>uncertain,</hi> which the Scripture hath determin'd; So no plauſibility whatſoever can come in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with the determinations of God, ſuch as thoſe of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56517:75"/>are. But ſuch it ſeems is the reſtleſneſs of ſome Men's minds, that if they cannot ſatisfie their ſcruples from what the Scripture hath advanced, they will be ſetting up other <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> to do it by. Wherein yet they are for the moſt part ſo unlucky, as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance ſuch things themſelves, as have nothing at all of probability in them. For who can think it any way probable, that, if mens Souls had an exiſtence antecedent to their conception in the Womb, they ſhould not in the leaſt be conſcious of it, nor of any of thoſe things, which were tranſacted by them in it? Is it (as one hath obſerv'd, who ſeems to have been the firſt broacher of it in this latter Age) is it, I ſay, for want of opportunity of being remind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their former tranſactions, as it happens to many, who riſe confident that they ſlept without dreaming, and yet before they go to bed again recover a whole ſeries of repreſentations by ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that occurr'd to them in the day? But who can think, when the Souls of Men muſt be ſuppoſed to carry in them the ſame evil tendencies, and inclinations, that they ſhould never light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any one thing, which might bring back to their minds what they had formerly tranſacted, or but ſo much as that they had a being antecedent to their preſent one? For whoever was ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful of his dreams, as not to remember he was ſometime in a dreaming condition, yea that he actually dreamed in it? Is it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly (as the ſame Learned Man goes on) by a deſuetude of thinking of their former actions, and whereby it ſometimes comes to paſs, as he there obſerves, that what we have earneſtly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated, labour'd for, and pen'd down with our own hands, when we were at School, becomes ſo loſt to our memories, that if we did not ſee our own handwriting to it, we ſhould not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it to be our own? But doth this come home to the preſent caſe? Doth it perſuade ſuch a forgetfulneſs in the Souls of Men, as not only not to remember their particular actions, but not ſo much as that they were in a condition to act any thing, or acted any thing under it? For though a Man may forget the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar exerciſe he did at School, yet can any Man (though he ſlept an Age, and never ſo much as dream'd in all that time of being at School, or any other thing, be ſuppoſed, if he awoke in his right wits, to forget he was ſometime in ſuch a place, and performed ſome exerciſes in it? Is it laſtly by means of ſome diſtemper, that happens to the Soul by coming into an earthly Body, and by which the foremention'd perſon conceives the Soul may ſuffer in its me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, as we ſee it ſometime doth in its preſent ſtate by caſualties, and diſeaſes, yea ſo far as to make the perſon forget his own name? But though the Soul ſhould be ſuppoſed to fall into ſuch a forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs by entring into a body (as we ſee it is a long time before it comes to exerciſe its reſpective faculties) yet is there any reaſon to think it ſhould continue in it after it hath gotten above the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of the other, yea ſo far as to reaſon with that clearneſs, wherewith this Author doth in many things, and with great plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility in all others? For though Men may happen to be ſo ſtrick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by a diſeaſe, as to forget even their own names, yea have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly ſuffered in that nature; yet is there no evidence from ſtory that I know of, or indeed preſumption for the ſuppoſition
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56517:76"/>of it, that though the parties did again recover the free uſe of their faculties, yet they were unable to look back to their priſtine ſtate, or call to mind any of the paſſages thereof. So much more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, than ſtrong are the reaſons that Author alledgeth to ſhew the Soul to be in a natural incapacity to call to mind its priſtin ſtate, and actions. And yet if they prov'd what they intended, they would hardly make it credible, that it ſhould be without all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them: God, who thruſts it down into its preſent ſtate by reaſon of its former errours, being likely enough to bring them to its mind, though it ſhould be otherwiſe ignorant of them. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he ſhould neither make it ſenſible of its own guilt, and his chooſing thus to puniſh it, which is one ſuppoſed end of his thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it down, nor careful to break off from it, which is another. And I ſhall only add, that as we cannot therefore be in any great danger from thoſe Objections, which pretend to derive Original ſin from another principle; So ſhall we not now be much incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded by the force of thoſe Objections, which profeſs more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to impugn the derivation of it from <hi>Adam.</hi> For as thoſe Objections are principally founded upon the incompetency of <hi>Adam</hi> to involve all mankind in the guilt of his tranſgreſſion, ſo I have not only made it appear already, that <hi>Adam</hi> was no way incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent for that purpoſe, becauſe appointed by God as the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative of all mankind, but ſaid enough, though not to anſwer, yet to ſilence what is objected againſt it from the ſuppoſed want of our conſent to his tranſgreſſion. Which will leave nothing more for us to do, than to conſider what is objected againſt the <hi>means,</hi> we have before aſſign'd of the conveying of that Original Sin where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we ſpeak. But as I have not been poſitive in aſſigning the <hi>particular</hi> means of its conveyance, and muſt therefore be the leſs concern'd to anſwer what is objected againſt them; So I ſhall oppoſe to all thoſe Objections the aſſurance we have from the Scripture of our having it in us from our Conception, and Birth, yea contracting it from thoſe fleſhly, and unclean perſons, from whom we are deſcended: That, as it is enough to ſhew that it is conveyed to us by the ſame general means, by which our very nature is, ſo making it at leaſt probable that it paſſeth from them to us together with our Souls, and from thence diffuſeth it ſelf unto our Bodies. And how far a probability ſo founded ought to prevail againſt all the Arguments, which are oppos'd to the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Souls, eſpecially when the Scripture ſeems to favour that traduction alſo, will be no hard matter for him to judge, who ſhall conſider on the one hand the ſhortneſs of our own reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and on the other what difficulties attend the Creation, and Infuſion, as well as the traduction of Souls. For as thoſe very difficulties will oblige us to ſit down after all with a probable aſſent in this affair, ſo the ſhortneſs of our own reaſonings to guide that aſſent rather by probable teſtimonies of Scripture, than by probable arguments from Reaſon: Becauſe as we are more aſſur'd of the truth of thoſe teſtimonies, than we can be of the truth of any of thoſe arguments, which we ground our ſelves upon in this affair; So we cannot ſo eaſily fail in our apprehenſions concerning
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56517:76"/>the other; Nothing more being requir'd toward the apprehending the force of the former, than the due conſideration of the ſenſe of the words, wherein they are expreſſed, whereas to the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending of the force of the latter we muſt have a clear knowledge of the nature of thoſe things, about which they are converſant, which is certainly a matter of far greater difficulty, and wherein therefore we may more eaſily miſtake. Only if what is ſaid in this particular may not be thought to be ſatisfactory, becauſe rather a bar to what is objected againſt the traduction of Souls (and conſequently of Original Sin) than any direct anſwer to it; I ſhall deſire thoſe, who are diſſatisfi'd with it, to give ſuch an anſwer, as they themſelves demand to what is objected by the other party againſt the immediate Creation, and infuſion of them: It ſeeming not ſo eaſie to imagine (that I may not now preſs them with any other inconveniencies) that God ſhould create a Soul on purpoſe to infuſe it into ſuch inceſtuous conceptions, as he himſelf cannot but be thought to abhor. For my ſelf, as I can with equal eaſe digeſt the traduction of Souls with all its inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, or rather acquieſce in that evidence, which the Doctrine of the Scripture, and the ſimple nature of a generation do ſeem to ſuggeſt; So I ſhall hardly think it reaſonable to quit it, till they, who aſſert the Creation of Souls, free it from the former incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, and other ſuch difficulties, wherewith it is alike encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. For till that be done, the traduction of Souls will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be of greater probability, but ſerve more clearly to declare how that corruption, which our firſt Parents contracted, paſſed from them unto their Children, and ſo on to ſucceding Generations.</p>

Of the former ſort again is that inward and Spiritual Grace, which tends to free us from the guilt of ſin, beſt known by the name of <hi>forgiveneſs,</hi> or that which tends to free us from the pollution of ſin, called by our Catechiſm <hi>a death unto it,</hi> or laſtly that which tends to introduce the contrary purity, and hath the name of <hi>a new birth unto Righteouſneſs.</hi> Of the latter ſort is our <hi>union to that body,</hi> of which Chriſt Jeſus is the head, and by means of which he diſpenſeth the former Graces to us. For that each of theſe is ſignified on the part of God by the outward viſible ſign of Baptiſm, and conſequently is a part of its inward and Spiritual Grace, will appear if we deſcend to particulars, which therefore I will now ſet my ſelf to do.</p>
                     <p>To begin with thoſe inward, and Spiritual Graces, which <hi>tend more immediately</hi> to our ſpiritual, and eternal welfare; Among which as I aſſign'd the firſt place to <hi>forgiveneſs of ſin,</hi> ſo I ſhall make it my buſineſs to ſhew firſt, that that is a Grace which is ſignified by the outward viſible ſign of Baptiſm, and Secondly give a more particular account of the nature of that forgiveneſs, which I have ſaid to be ſignified by the other.</p>
                     <p>That <hi>forgiveneſs of ſin</hi> is a Grace ſignified by the outward vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſign of Baptiſm, will appear if theſe two things can be made out; Firſt, that the outward viſible ſign of Baptiſm hath a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the forgiveneſs of ſin, and Secondly that it hath the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſign unto it. For if the outward viſible ſign of Baptiſm hath the relation of a ſign to the forgiveneſs of ſin, Forgiveneſs of ſin, as being its <hi>correlatum,</hi> muſt be look'd upon as ſignified by it. That the outward viſible ſign of Baptiſm hath a <hi>relation</hi> to the forgiveneſs of ſin, S. <hi>Peter</hi> will not ſuffer us to doubt, becauſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing<note n="†" place="margin">Act. 2.38.</note>
                        <pb n="67" facs="tcp:56517:78"/>the <hi>Jews</hi> to be <hi>baptiz'd for the remiſſion of ſins;</hi> And as little doubt can there well be of its having the relation of a <hi>ſign</hi> unto it, which is the only thing we are at preſent to conſider: Partly, becauſe Baptiſm hath been before<note n="*" place="margin">Of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments in general, Part 2.</note> ſhewn to have been intended by God as a ſign of many things, and why then not as a ſign of that forgiveneſs, to which I have ſhewn it equally to relate, and partly becauſe it is propos'd to us as <hi>waſhing away</hi>
                        <note n="(a)" place="margin">Acts 22.16.</note> 
                        <hi>the ſins</hi> of thoſe, that are ſprinkled with it. For as if the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Baptiſm be to be conſidered as <hi>waſhing away Men's ſins,</hi> it muſt be upon the account of its being a ſign of that inward Grace thereof, that doth ſo, as which alone can be a juſt foundation of attributing ſuch a property to it (for neither can the Water of Baptiſm put away Men's ſins, but by means of that Grace, which it conveys, nor with any propriety even ſo be ſaid to <hi>waſh</hi> them away, but upon the account of the likeneſs there is between its own natural property, and that of the divine Grace, which will make the Water of Baptiſm a ſign, or repreſentation of it) So if the Water of Baptiſm be to be conſidered as <hi>waſhing</hi> away Men's ſins, it will equally lead us to believe, that it ought to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in particular as a ſign of that forgiveneſs, whereof we ſpeak: Partly, becauſe that forgiveneſs is an undoubted <hi>correlatum</hi> of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and partly becauſe the term of <hi>waſhing</hi> away Men's ſins is moſt frequently made uſe of to denote the forgiveneſs of ſins, and that outward ſign therefore, to which ſuch a waſhing is attributed, intended as a ſign of the forgiveneſs of them. I conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that whatever elſe may be thought to be excluded from the ſignification of the Water of Baptiſm, yet it hath the relation of a ſign to the forgiveneſs of ſin, and that forgiveneſs therefore to be look'd upon as one of the <hi>Graces</hi> ſignified by it. And I ſhall only add, that this was always ſo acknowledg'd in the Church, that even the <hi>Pelagians</hi> themſelves, though they deny'd all ſin in Infants, and conſequently left no place for the forgiveneſs of ſin in them, yet did allow of their being <hi>Baptiz'd for the remiſſion of ſins according to the rule of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church, and the tenour of the Goſpel,</hi> as appears from the words of <hi>Pelagius</hi> himſelf<note n="(b)" place="margin">Vid.

                     <p>There being therefore no doubt to be made, that forgiveneſs of ſin is one of thoſe inward, and Spiritual Graces, which are ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by Baptiſm, it may not be amiſs for the farther clearing of that Grace, to ſay ſomewhat concerning the nature of it, both as to thoſe ſins it pretends to aſſoile, and the meaſure of its forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

And I have inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted ſo much the longer both upon this <hi>particular,</hi> and the Text I have made uſe of to confirm it, becauſe as Original Sin is one main ground of Baptiſm, and accordingly in this very <hi>Catechiſm</hi> of ours repreſented by our Church as ſuch, ſo ſhe may ſeem to make uſe of that very Text to evidence the being of Original Sin, and the efficacy of Baptiſm toward the removing of it: Her words being, that as <hi>we are by nature born in ſin, and the Children of wrath, ſo we are by Baptiſm made the Children of Grace.</hi>

For what is this but to ſay, that it was intended as a ſign, or repreſentation of them both, and both the one, and the other therefore to be look'd upon as ſignified by it. The ſame is to be ſaid upon the account of thoſe Texts of Scripture, which repreſent the Water of Baptiſm as <hi>waſhing</hi>

                        <hi>the Church, to the end it may be holy, and without blemiſh.</hi> For as that ſhews the Water of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to have a relation to that grace, which tends to free the Church from ſinful blemiſhes, ſo it ſhews in like manner, that it was intended as a ſign of it, and of that inward cleanſing, which belongs to it: There being not otherwiſe any reaſon why the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Church from ſin by means of the Baptiſmal water ſhould
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56517:79"/>have the name of <hi>cleanſing,</hi> but upon the account of the analogy there is between the natural property thereof, and the property of that Grace, to which it relates.</p>
                     <p>One only Grace remains of thoſe, which tend more immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to our ſpiritual welfare, even that which our Catechiſm entitles a <hi>new birth unto righteouſneſs.</hi> Concerning which I ſhall again ſhew (becauſe that will be enough to prove, that it is a Grace ſignified by it) that the Water of Baptiſm hath a relation to it, and then that it hath the relation of a ſign. I alledge for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of theſe S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s entitling it the <hi>laver of regeneration</hi>
                        <note n="(o)" place="margin">Tit. 3.5.</note>, as our Saviour's affirming<note n="(p)" place="margin">Joh. 3.5.</note> before him, that we are <hi>born again</hi> of that, as well as <hi>of the Spirit;</hi> For the latter what hath been before ſhewn in the general concerning its having been intended as a ſign of the things, to which it relates. For if the Water of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm were intended as a ſign of thoſe things, to which it relates, it muſt conſequently have bin intended as a ſign of our new birth, becauſe by the former Texts as manifeſtly relating to it. But ſo we ſhall be yet more fully perſwaded, if it carry in it a repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of that new birth, to which it doth relate. Which that it doth will need no other proof, than its being an apt repreſentation of that ſpiritual purity, which the Soul puts on at its firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and wherein indeed its new birth<note n="(q)" place="margin">Eph. 4.24.</note> conſiſts. For ſo it is in part by that cleanſing quality, which is natural to it, and which induceth a purity in thoſe bodies, to which it is applied; But eſpecially by the uſe that was formerly made of it toward the waſhing of new-born Infants from thoſe impurities, which they contracted from the Womb: This laſt ſerving to ſet forth the firſt beginnings of our ſpiritual purity, as well as the former doth that purity it ſelf. And I ſhall only add, that as a reſurrection from the Dead is alſo a kind of new Birth, and accordingly ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by the Scriptures themſelves (witneſs their entituling our Saviour upon the account of his Reſurrection <hi>the firſt-begotten</hi>
                        <note n="(r)" place="margin">Col. 1.18.</note> 
                        <hi>from the dead,</hi> yea making that Reſurrection of his to be a completion<note n="(ſ)" place="margin">Acts 13.33.</note> of that ſignal prediction of God<note n="(t)" place="margin">Pſal. 2.7.</note> 
                        <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee</hi>) So the ſame Scriptures do not only repreſent our new birth unto Righteouſneſs under the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Reſurrection, but ſufficiently intimate that whether Birth or Reſurrection to be a Grace ſignified by it: Becauſe not only admoniſhing us to look upon our ſelves as <hi>alive unto God</hi> by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm<note n="(u)" place="margin">Rom. 6.11.</note>, as well as <hi>dead unto ſin</hi> in it, but as <hi>riſen</hi>

                        <hi>with Chriſt therein through the faith of the operation of him, who raiſed him from the dead.</hi> For how come Men by reaſon of their being alive unto God through Baptiſm to be affirmed to have riſen with Chriſt in it, but upon the account of that Baptiſm of theirs being a repreſentation of that new life, or birth, which we have by the means of it, as well as of the Reſurrection of our Saviour?</p>
                     <p>I will conclude what I have to ſay concerning the inward, and Spiritual Grace of Baptiſm, when I have taken notice of that, which though it do not immediately tend to our ſpiritual, and eternal welfare, yet qualifies us for thoſe Graces, that do; Even our <hi>union to that Body,</hi> of which Chriſt Jeſus is the Head, and by means of which he diſpenſeth the other graces to us. For that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56517:80"/>that is alſo ſignified by the outward viſible ſign of Baptiſm, will appear if we conſider that viſible ſign as having a relation to it, and then as having the relation of a ſign. Of the former where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as S. <hi>Paul</hi> will not ſuffer us to doubt, becauſe affirming all<note n="(x)" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13.</note> whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles</hi> to be <hi>baptiz'd</hi> into that body; So there will be as little doubt of the other from the general deſign of its inſtitution, and from what S. <hi>Paul</hi> intimates in the former place concerning it: That expreſſion of being <hi>baptized into</hi> the body of Chriſt importing our being receiv'd by Baptiſm within it, as the body of the Baptized is within thoſe waters, wherein he is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſed. Which will conſequently make that Rite a true, and proper ſign of Our Union to Chriſt's Body, and that union therefore a thing ſignified by it.</p>
                     <p>Such are the things, which are by Baptiſm ſignified <hi>on the part of God, and Chriſt,</hi> or (that I may ſpeak in the language of our Church) the <hi>inward, and ſpiritual Graces</hi> thereof. It remains that I alſo ſhew the things ſignified by it <hi>on the part of the Baptized,</hi> even an Abrenunciation of their former ſins, and a reſolution to believe, and act, as Chriſtianity obligeth them to do. But becauſe both the one, and the other of theſe will be more clearly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, if they be handled apart, and whatſoever is to be known concerning each of them laid as near together as may be; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having begun to entreat of the inward and ſpiritual Grace of Baptiſm, I will continue my Diſcourſe concerning it, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly go on to enquire <hi>what farther relation</hi> the outward viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſign of Baptiſm hath to its inward and Spiritual Grace, or Graces, and firſt of all to Forgiveneſs of ſin.</p>

But beſide the ſuffrage of the <hi>Church</hi> of God, which both publiſh'd this Doctrine in her <hi>Creed,</hi> and argued others from it; It is farther to be obſerv'd, that thoſe, who were none of the <hi>ſoundeſt</hi> members of it, nor indeed as yet <hi>perfect</hi> ones, confirm'd it by their opinions, and practices, as <hi>they</hi> alſo did in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, who yet ſeparated from it in this affair.

For which ſoever of theſe two were the occaſion of that delay, manifeſt it is even from thence, that they had a high opinion of the forgiveneſs of ſin by Baptiſm, but much more from the hazard they ran of going out of the World without it, and the contrariety of that their delay to the practice of the firſt Chriſtians<note n="(d)" place="margin">Acts 2.41.</note>, as well as to the ſentiments<note n="(e)" place="margin">Cod.

And it ought the rather to be taken notice of, becauſe as it bears witneſs to that forgiveneſs of ſin by Baptiſm, which hath been hitherto our deſign to advance, ſo it will contribute in part toward the proving, what comes next in order, even</p>
                     <p>That the outward viſible ſign of Baptiſm hath that relation, whereof we ſpeak, to the forgiveneſs of <hi>all ſins</hi> whatſoever, and particularly of <hi>Original Sin:</hi> There being little doubt as to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merof theſe, if (as Chriſtianity is there made to ſpeak) <hi>adultery, and murther were waſh'd away by the waters of it.</hi> But ſo that Chriſtianity it ſelf taught, as well as was affirmed by this its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary to do, is not only evident from what hath been elſewhere ſaid<note n="(i)" place="margin">Expl. of the Creed.

                        </note> concerning its tendering forgiveneſs of ſins <hi>indefinitely,</hi> and particularly in the <hi>laver of Baptiſm,</hi> but from the quality of thoſe criminals, whom it invited to forgiveneſs by it. For thus we find it to have done thoſe <hi>Jews</hi>

But therefore as I cannot either conceive, or allow of any other abatement in this forgiveneſs, than that which is to be made upon account of the <hi>ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and which what it is, hath been elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where<note n="(o)" place="margin">Expl. of the Creed.

Not that there can be any great doubt as to the pardon of that, where it appears that the moſt <hi>heinous actual</hi> ſins are pardoned, but becauſe Baptiſm hath been thought by our <hi>Church</hi>
                        <note n="(p)" place="margin">See the Office of Bapt. and the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm.</note> to have a more peculiar reference to it, and becauſe if it can be prov'd to have ſuch a reference to its forgiveneſs, it will be of ſignal uſe to ſhew the neceſſity of baptizing Infants, in whom that ſin doth alike predominate. Now though it be hard to find any one Text of Scripture, where that forgiveneſs, whereof we ſpeak, is expreſly attributed to Baptiſm; Yet will it not be difficult to deduce it from that<note n="(q)" place="margin">Eph. 2.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note>, which I have before ſhewn to entreat of our becoming the <hi>children of wrath by nature,</hi> as well as by the wickedneſs of our converſations. For oppoſing to the corruption, or rather <hi>deadneſs,</hi> which accrues by both, <hi>the quickning we have together with Chriſt,</hi> and which <hi>quickning</hi> he elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where<note n="(r)" place="margin">Col. 2.12.</note> as expreſly affirms to be accompliſhed in us by Baptiſm; Affirming moreover that <hi>quickning</hi> to bring <hi>ſalvation</hi>

                     <p>Such evidence there is of the outward viſible ſign of Baptiſm being a <hi>means</hi> fitted by God to convey that forgiveneſs, whereof we ſpeak; And we ſhall need no other proof than that of its being alſo a <hi>pledge</hi> to aſſure the baptized perſon of it.

                     <p>To begin (as is but meet) with that, which hath the name of a <hi>Death unto ſin,</hi> becauſe ſin muſt be firſt ſubdu'd, before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary quality can be introduc'd; Where firſt I will enquire what we are to underſtand by it, and then what evidence there is of the ſign of Baptiſm's being fitted to convey it.</p>
                     <p>For the better underſtanding the former whereof we are to know, that as Men by the corruption of their nature are inclined unto ſin, and yet more by the irregularity of their converſations, ſo thoſe inclinations are to the perſons in whom they are, as a principle of life to a living Creature, and accordingly do both diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to act ſutably thereto, and make them brisk, and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in it. Now as it cannot well be expected, that where ſuch inclinations prevail, Men ſhould purſue thoſe things, which piety, and vertue prompt them to, ſo it was the buſineſs of Philoſophy firſt, and afterwards of Religion, if not wholly to deſtroy thoſe inclinations, yet at leaſt to ſubdue them in ſuch ſort, that they ſhould be in a manner dead, and the perſons, in whom they were, ſo far forth dead alſo; They neither finding in themſelves the like inclinations to actual ſin, nor hurried on by them, when they did. How little able Philoſophy was to contribute to ſo bleſſed an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is not my buſineſs to ſhew, nor indeed will there be any need of it, after what I have elſewhere<note n="*" place="margin">Expl. of the Crced. Art. <hi>I believe in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                        </note> ſaid concerning the neceſſity of the divine Grace in order to it. But as Chriſtianity doth every where pretend to the doing of it, and (which is more) both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents that effect under the name of a <hi>death unto ſin,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares Men's thus dying with that natural death, which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our underwent, ſo it may the more reaſonably pretend to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of it, becauſe it alſo pretends to furniſh Men with the power of his Grace, to which ſuch an effect cannot be ſuppos'd to be diſproportionate. The only thing in queſtion as to our preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment is, whether as the outward work of Baptiſm hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the relation of a ſign unto it, ſo it hath alſo the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a <hi>means</hi> fitted by God for the conveying of it, and what evidence there is of that relation.</p>
                     <p>Now there are two ſorts of Texts, which bear witneſs to this relation, as well as to its having that more confeſſed relation of a ſign. Whereof the former entreat of this Grace under the title of a <hi>death unto ſin,</hi> the latter of a <hi>cleanſing</hi> from it. Of the former ſort I reckon that well known place to the <hi>Romans,</hi> where S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not only ſuppoſe all true Chriſtians<note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 6.2.</note> to be <hi>dead to ſin,</hi> and accordingly argue from it the unfitneſs of their <hi>living any longer</hi> therein, but affirm <hi>all, that are baptized into Jeſus Chriſt</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 6.3.</note>, <hi>to be baptized into</hi> that <hi>death,</hi> yea to be <hi>buried by Baptiſm</hi>

For ſhall we ſay that S. <hi>Paul</hi> meant no more by all this, than that the deſign of Baptiſm, and the ſeveral parts of it was to repreſent to us the neceſſity of our dying, and being buried as to ſin, and that accordingly all, that are baptized into Chriſt, make profeſſion of their reſolution ſo to do, but not that they are indeed buried by Baptiſm as to that particular. But beſide that we are not lightly to depart from the propriety of the Scripture phraſe
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56517:84"/>which muſt be acknowledg'd rather to favour a real death, than the bare ſignification of it; That Apoſtle doth moreover affirm thoſe, whom he before deſcrib'd as <hi>dead,</hi> to be <hi>freed</hi>

                        <note n="(g)" place="margin">Col. 2.11.</note> though va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying a little from the other, as to the manner of expreſſion. For having affirmed them through Chriſt to <hi>have put off the body of the ſins of the fleſh by a circumciſion not made with hands,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently by a ſpiritual one, he yet adds (leſt any ſhould fancy that ſpiritual Circumciſion to accrue to them without ſome cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial one) in the <hi>Circumciſion of Chriſt,</hi> even that <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> which, conformably to the circumciſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for their entrance into his Religion by, and wherein he accordingly affirms, as he did in the former place, that they were not only <hi>buried with him,</hi> but had <hi>riſen together with him by the faith of the operation of God, who raiſed him from the dead.</hi> From whence as it is clear, that the <hi>putting off the body of the ſins of the fleſh</hi> (which is but another expreſſion for a death unto them) is though accompliſhed by a ſpiritual Grace, yet by ſuch a one, as is conveyed to us by Baptiſm, ſo it becomes yet more clear by what he adds concerning Men's <hi>riſing with him</hi> in the ſame Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, even to a life contrary to what they had before depoſited, <hi>through the faith of the operation of God.</hi> For as we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of that <hi>riſing with Chriſt</hi> as other than a real one, becauſe there would not otherwiſe have needed ſuch a <hi>faith,</hi> as that, to bring it about; So neither therefore but think the like of that <hi>death,</hi> which it preſuppoſeth, and conſequently that that Baptiſm, to which it is annex'd, is a means of conveying it, as well as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of it. But ſo we may be yet more convinc'd by ſuch Texts of <hi>Scripture,</hi> as ſpeak of this <hi>death unto ſin</hi> under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>cleanſing from it.</hi> Of which nature is that ſo often al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged one<note n="(h)" place="margin">Eph. 5.26, 27.</note> concerning Chriſt's <hi>ſanctifying, and cleanſing his Church with the waſhing of water by the word.</hi> For as it appears from what is afterwards ſubjoyn'd as the end of that <hi>cleanſing,</hi> even that the Church <hi>might not have any ſpot, or wrinkle, but that it ſhould be holy, and without blemiſh;</hi> As it appears, I ſay, from thence, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the verſe before concerning a <hi>cleanſing from the filth of ſin,</hi> which is but another expreſſion for <hi>the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the body of ſin,</hi> or a <hi>death</hi> unto it; So it appears in like manner from S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s attributing that <hi>cleanſing</hi> to the <hi>waſhing of water,</hi> that the outward ſign of Baptiſm is by the appointment, and proviſion of God, a means of conveying that ſpiritual Grace, by which that cleanſing is more immediately effected, and that death unto ſin procur'd.</p>

But of all the Antient Fathers, that have entreated of this affair, or indeed of that Sacrament, which we are now upon the conſideration of, there is no one, who hath ſpoken more, or more to the purpoſe than S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> or whoſe words therefore will be more fit to conſider. Only, that I may not multiply teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies without neceſſity, I will content my ſelf with one ſingle one, but which indeed for the fulneſs thereof will ſerve inſtead of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and be moreover as clear a teſtimony of our <hi>dying unto ſin</hi> by Baptiſm, as of our <hi>regeneration</hi> by it. For <hi>when</hi> (ſaith he<note n="(ſ)" place="margin">Epiſt. ad Donat.</note>) <hi>I lay in darkneſs, and under the obſcurity of the Night; When un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain and doubtful I floated on the Sea of this toſſing World, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of my own life, and as great a ſtranger to truth, I thought it exceeding difficult, as the manners of Men then were, that any one ſhould be born again, as the divine mercy had promis'd, and that being animated to a new life by the laver of ſalutary water, he ſhould put off that which he was before, and whilſt the frame of his body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd the ſame, become a new Man in his heart, and mind. For how</hi> (ſaid I) <hi>is it poſſible, that that ſhould be ſuddenly put off, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being natural is now grown hard by the natural ſituation of the matter, or contracted by a long cuſtom hath been improv'd by old Age,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>To theſe, and the like purpoſes I often diſcours'd with my ſelf; For as I was at that time entangled with many errours of my former life, which I did not then think it was poſſible for me to put off; So I willingly gave obedience to thoſe vices, that ſtuck to me, and through a deſpair of better things, I favour'd my evils, as though they had been my proper, and domeſtick ones. But after that through the aſſiſtance of this generating water the blemiſhes of my former life were waſh'd off, and my mind thus purged had a light from above poured into it; Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the ſecond birth had chang'd me into a new Man through the force of that ſpirit, or breath, which I ſuck'd in from above; Then
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56517:86"/>thoſe things, which were before doubtful, became exceeding certain, and manifeſt; things; which were before ſhut, were then laid open, and dark things made light. Then that, which before ſeemed difficult, appear'd to help, rather than hinder, and that, which ſometime was thought impoſſible, as poſſible to be done. So that it was not difficult to diſcern, that that was earthly, which being carnally born did before live obnoxious to faults, and that that began to be God's, which the Holy Ghoſt now animated. You your ſelf verily know, and will as readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge with me, what was either taken from, or beſtow'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us by that death of crimes, and life of vertues.</hi> Which as it is an illuſtrious teſtimony of the force of Baptiſm in this particular, and with what reaſon we have affirm'd it to be a means of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the former <hi>death,</hi> and <hi>birth;</hi> So I have the more willingly taken notice of it, becauſe it comes ſo near even in its expreſſion to what our <hi>Catechiſm</hi> hath repreſented as the <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual Grace</hi> thereof: There being no great difference between <hi>a death of crimes, and life of vertues,</hi> which is the expreſſion of that <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>a death unto ſin, and a new birth unto righteouſneſs,</hi> which is the <hi>other's.</hi> And I ſhall only add, that as the Doctrine of the Church muſt therefore be thought to bear ſufficient teſtimony to Baptiſm's being a <hi>means</hi> of our <hi>regeneration;</hi> So its practice is in this particular anſwerable to its Doctrine, and though in another way proclaims the ſame thing.

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56517:88"/>on whom it is beſtow'd. For as that is all I ask at preſent concerning the Union now in queſtion; So what I farther mean by it's being an inward, and ſpiritual Grace ſhall be clear'd in the proceſs of this Diſcourſe, and receive that eſtabliſhment, which it requires. In order whereunto I will ſhew the outward and viſible ſign of Baptiſm to be a <hi>means,</hi> whereby that Union is made, and then point out the <hi>conſequences</hi> of that Union.</p>
                     <p>That the outward viſible ſign of Baptiſm is in the nature of a <hi>means, whereby we are united to the Church,</hi> will appear if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon what the <hi>Scripture</hi> hath ſaid concerning it; or the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing declarations of the <hi>Church</hi> it ſelf. For what elſe (to begin with the former) can S. <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 12.13.</note> be thought to mean, where he affirms all whether <hi>Jews,</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or of what ever other outward dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, to have been <hi>baptiz'd by one ſpirit into one body?</hi> For as it is plain from the foregoing<note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 12.12.</note> verſe, or verſes, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Body the Church, and conſequently that the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing here ſpoken of muſt be meant of our <hi>Baptizing into it;</hi> So it is alike plain from what it was deſigned to prove, as well as from the natural force of the expreſſion, that it was ſet to denote alſo our being <hi>united</hi> to it thereby. For as we cannot impoſe a more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſenſe upon <hi>Baptized into that body,</hi> than our being receiv'd by Baptiſm into it, as the Baptized perſon is within the water, and conſequently ſome way united to it; So much leſs if we conſider what it was intended to prove, even<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 12.12.</note> that Chriſtians, how many ſoever, are but that <hi>one body.</hi> For how doth their being <hi>baptiz'd into it</hi> prove them to be that one Body, but that that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſign, by which they are ſo, unites them to one another, and to the whole? A <hi>meer</hi> ſign of Union, though it may ſhew what the partakers thereof ought to be, yet being no juſt proof of what they are, and much leſs (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to argue) that they are ſo by the means of it. And indeed, as it will therefore be hard to make the ſign here ſpoken of to be any thing leſs than a means of our Union to the Church; So eſpecially, if we conſider what is elſewhere ſaid concerning thoſe, who firſt after the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt, were baptized in the name of Chriſt: S. <hi>Luke</hi> not only affirming of thoſe new baptiz'd ones, that they were <hi>added to</hi>
                        <note n="(a)" place="margin">Acts 2.41.</note> the Apoſtles, and their other company, (which he afterwards expreſſeth<note n="(b)" place="margin">Acts 2.47.</note> by <hi>added to the Church</hi>) but that they were partakers<note n="(c)" place="margin">Acts 2.42.</note> with the reſt in the <hi>Apoſtles Doctrine, and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, and in breaking of bread, and in Prayers.</hi> For this ſhews their having an intereſt in all the priviledges of that Body, and therefore much more their being united to it. But ſo it appears that the Antient Church eſteemed of it, whoſe determination is of the more force, becauſe it is only about the ſuppoſed means of Union to its own Body; <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> after he had ſpoken of the baptizing of ſuch as offer'd themſelves to the Chriſtian Church (which he himſelf expreſſeth, when ſo baptiz'd, by <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56517:88"/>as then admitted to, becauſe the ſame Father doth not only make no diſtinction between them, and the other brethren in it, though he ſubjoyns the buſineſs of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> to the former Prayers, and <hi>kiſs of peace,</hi> but affirms the ſame Euchariſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after to be <hi>lawful to none to partake of, but thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd</hi> their Doctrine, receiv'd the <hi>laver of regeneration,</hi> and <hi>liv'd as Chriſt delivered.</hi> For as he intimates there by the admiſſion of thoſe that believ'd, and were baptiz'd, if they were alſo ſuch as liv'd as Chriſt deliver'd, which the new baptized were in reaſon to be accounted, till they had given proof to the contrary; So there is reaſon to believe from the uſe of <hi>Excommunication</hi> in the Church, that that addition of <hi>living as Chriſt deliver'd</hi> was not made to bar the new baptized from it, till they gave farther proof of ſuch a life, but to intimate the excluſion of thoſe, who, after they had been admitted to it, liv'd otherwiſe, than Chriſtianity preſcrib'd: So making the perſons excluded the <hi>unbaptiz'd,</hi> or <hi>ill li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſtians,</hi> and conſequently the contrary thereto admitted. I deny not indeed, that the Rite of <hi>Confirmation</hi> did very antiently come between the receiving of Baptiſm, and the Euchariſt. I deny not farther, becauſe of what was before<note n="(d)" place="margin">Expl. of the Sacrament in general.

But as the deſign of Confirmation appears to have been to procure for the new baptiz'd a more plentiful effuſion of God's Graces, which is no intimation at all of his having been before no perfect Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, or not perfectly united to the Church, ſo Baptiſm may for all that be look'd upon as the means of our Union to the Church, which is all, that I have taken upon me to aſſert. For the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evidencing whereof I will in the next place alledge a paſſage of <hi>Tertullian</hi>

                        </note>, which will, though not ſo directly, prove the ſame thing; That I mean where he ſaith, that <hi>when the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our faith, and ſponſion of our ſalvation are pledged under the three witneſſes</hi> before ſpoken of, <hi>there is neceſſarily added thereto the mention of the Church, becauſe where thoſe three are, even the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, there is alſo the Church, which is the body of the Three.</hi> For as it is evident from thence, that Men were even from his time baptiz'd expreſly into the belief of the <hi>Church,</hi> as well as into the belief of the <hi>Trinity;</hi> So it will not be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to inferr, that they were alſo baptiz'd into the unity thereof, and made members of the Church by it: Becauſe as he affirms the <hi>Trinity</hi> to become Sponſors of our Salvation in Baptiſm, as well as either Witneſſes, or objects of our Profeſſion; So he affirms thoſe Sponſors to be as it were embodyed in the Church, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to exert their ſaving influences within it, which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth Men's being united to it by Baptiſm in order to their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the ſalutarineſs of the other. And indeed, though in that form, which our Saviour preſcrib'd<note n="(f)" place="margin">Matt. 28.19.</note> for Baptiſm, there is mention only of baptizing in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, yet inaſmuch as he preſcrib'd that very form for the <hi>making of Diſciples</hi>
                        <note n="(g)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> by, he muſt conſequently be ſuppos'd to propoſe it for the aggregating them to that body, which he
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56517:89"/>had already begun to frame, and making them alike members of it.</p>
                     <p>There being therefore no doubt to be made of the outward vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſign of Baptiſm being a <hi>means of our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion to</hi> Chriſt's my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical body the Church, it may not be amiſs (if it were only to manifeſt the great advantages thereof, as to that particular) to ſhew the <hi>conſequences of that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi> Which we ſhall find in the general to be a right to all thoſe priviledges, which Chriſt hath purchas'd for it; More <hi>particularly</hi> to the partaking of its <hi>Sacred Offices,</hi> and in, and through the means of them of thoſe <hi>inward,</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual Graces,</hi> which thoſe Sacred Offices were intended to procure, or convey. For every member of a Society being by that memberſhip of his entituled to all the priviledges, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to it as ſuch; He, who becomes a member of Chriſt's Body, the Church (as every Man, who is united to it by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, doth) muſt in his proportion be entituled to all thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, which Chriſt hath purchas'd for it, and particularly to the priviledge of partaking of its ſacred Offices, and in, and by the means of them, of thoſe inward and ſpiritual Graces, which thoſe ſacred Offices were intended to procure, or convey.

                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:56517:90"/>
                     <p>That the <hi>things</hi> before mentioned are the things thus ſignified by it, hath alſo been elſewhere<note n="*" place="margin">Expl. of the Apoſtles Creed.</note> declar'd, and ſo, that it would not be difficult for a diligent Reader to ſatisfie himſelf from thence. But becauſe what I have ſaid concerning them lies diſperſedly in my former Diſcourſes, and would therefore require more pains, than I ought to impoſe upon my Reader, to find it out, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it to the preſent Argument; I will here, though very briefly, conſider them anew, and if not (which would be too tedious) repeat all that I have ſaid concerning them, yet point him as I go, to the particular places, from whence they may be fetch'd.</p>
                     <p>That <hi>Abrenunciation of ſin</hi> is one of the things ſignified by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is not only evident from the manner of adminiſtring it in the Primitive times, and which together with the form of their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brenunciation, and our own are ſet down in my account of the <hi>Preliminary queſtions, and anſwers</hi> of the Catechiſm, but alſo from the general tenour of that Religion, which Baptiſm is an initiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into; That requiring the renouncing of all ſin, and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and therefore ſuppoſing the baptized perſon to do ſo, when he takes that Religion upon him. For which cauſe as an expreſs Abrenunciation was heretofore requir'd, and continues ſo to be to this very day; So it was ſignified, as by other Rites, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly by the baptized perſons <hi>putting off his cloaths</hi> in order to his Baptiſm, as putting off together with them the <hi>Old Man,</hi> and <hi>his deeds,</hi> ſo by the Rite of Baptiſm it ſelf: He, who ſubmits to that, implying thereby his looking upon <hi>ſin</hi> as a Moral impurity, and which therefore for the future he would not have any thing to do with.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond thing ſignified by Baptiſm on the part of the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized is his <hi>preſent belief of the Doctrine of Chriſtianity,</hi> more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity.</hi> As is evident from that Baptiſm's being commanded by our Saviour to be made <hi>in,</hi> or <hi>into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> For to be baptiz'd <hi>into the name</hi> of thoſe perſons importing the owning of thoſe perſons as our <hi>Maſters</hi>
                        <note n="(a)" place="margin">Expl. of the Creed. Art. <hi>I believe in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                        </note>, and our ſelves as the <hi>Diſciples</hi> of them; To be ſo baptized moreover importing the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe perſons as <hi>alike</hi>
                        <note n="(b)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                        <hi>Maſters</hi> of us, and conſequently, becauſe the Father cannot be own'd in any lower relation, as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the ſame divine Nature, and Authority; Laſtly, to be ſo baptiz'd importing the owning of them in particular by a <hi>belief</hi> of the Chriſtian Doctrine, that being the moſt ſignal inſtance of that Diſcipleſhip, we receive by it; The belief of the Doctrine of Chriſtianity, and of the <hi>Trinity</hi> in particular muſt be look'd upon as ſignified by Baptiſm on the part of the baptized, and thoſe baptized ones conſequently as making profeſſion of that belief by it. For which cauſe as the <hi>rule of Faith,</hi> or the <hi>Creed</hi>
                        <note n="(c)" place="margin">Introd. concerning Catechiſing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> was given to thoſe to learn, who were willing to be initiated into Chriſtianity, ſo they were particularly interrogated<note n="(d)" place="margin">Expl. of the Prel. Queſt. and Anſwers.</note> as to their belief of the Articles thereof, and then, and not till then baptiz'd into it, and the priviledges thereof.</p>
                     <p>The third and laſt thing ſignified on the part of the baptized is a <hi>reſolution for the time to come to continue in the belief of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and act agreeably to its Laws.</hi> Both which will receive a
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56517:90"/>ſufficient confirmation from S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s affirming Baptiſm to be the <hi>Anſwer,</hi> or <hi>ſtipulation of a good conſcience toward God,</hi> and from what I have elſewhere<note n="(e)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> ſaid concerning it. For as it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from thence, that Baptiſm ſignifies on the part of the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized a ſtipulation, or promiſe of ſomewhat to be done by him; So it will not be difficult to inferr from thence, that it ſignifies alſo a ſtipulation, or promiſe to continue in that belief of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, into which he is baptiz'd, and act agreeably to its laws. As will appear, whether we conſider that ſtipulation as having <hi>a good conſcience toward God</hi> for the object of it (in which ſenſe I ſhould think S. <hi>Peter</hi> ought to be underſtood) or, as I find many others to do, as <hi>proceeding from ſuch a conſcience.</hi> For a <hi>good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> having a due regard to the ſeveral parts of that Religion, which it makes profeſſion to eſpouſe; He, who with relation to Chriſtianity ſtipulates <hi>from a good conſcience,</hi> or makes that good conſcience the object of his ſtipulation, muſt conſequently be thought to ſtipulate, or make a promiſe of anſwering the ſeveral parts of it, and therefore alſo (becauſe they are parts of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity) of continuing in its Faith, and acting agreeably to its Laws. And hence, (as was before<note n="(f)" place="margin">Expl. of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in general, Part 1.</note> obſerv'd) this, and the other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of our Religion had of old the name of <hi>Sacraments,</hi> as importing a Vow, or promiſe to Chriſt of believing in him, or obeying him. And hence alſo, that the Antients argued<note n="(g)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> the <hi>unlawfulneſs of ſuperinducing an humane,</hi> or military <hi>Sacrament up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a divine one,</hi> and <hi>anſwering to another Maſter after Chriſt.</hi> Which we ſhall the leſs need to wonder at, if we remember that that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, whereof we ſpeak, was copyed from the Baptiſm of the <hi>Jews</hi>
                        <note n="(h)" place="margin">Expl. of Baptiſm, Part 1.</note>, and particularly from that of <hi>John the Baptiſt.</hi> For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the former of theſe it hath been obſerv'd<note n="(i)" place="margin">Ibid.</note>, that <hi>thoſe three men, that preſided over it, lean'd over the baptized perſons as they ſtood in the water, and twice explain'd to them ſome of the more weighty, and lighter precepts of their Law.</hi> For what reaſon think we, but to let them know, that they were baptiz'd into the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the one, and the other, and that they accounted that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of their's as a Profeſſion of it? And though we do not find the like affirm'd concerning the Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> which becauſe an extraordinary one, and immediately <hi>from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> I have diſtinguiſhed from the other; Yet, which will come all to one, we find it entituled the <hi>Baptiſm of Repentance</hi>
                        <note n="(k)" place="margin">Mark 1.4. Acts 13.14.</note>, and (which is more) that Baptiſt enjoining upon thoſe <hi>Publicans</hi>
                        <note n="(l)" place="margin">Luk. 3.12, &amp;c.</note>, who came to be baptized by him, <hi>to exact no more than was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them,</hi> as upon thoſe <hi>Souldiers,</hi> that came upon the like er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, <hi>to do violence to no man, to accuſe no man falſly, and to be content with their wages:</hi> Such affirmations as theſe being pregnant proofs, that a reſolution of living piouſly, and vertuouſly was a thing ſignified on the part of the baptized, and that their taking upon them the former Baptiſms was a profeſſion of it. Now if that Profeſſion were the intendment of the former Baptiſms, and particularly of that of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> why not alſo of the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Eſpecially, when <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm of <hi>Repentance</hi> was to prepare men for the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> and to which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may ſuppoſe a ſtricter piety to belong, and they, who were
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56517:91"/>baptiz'd into that Kingdom, plung'd more deeply into the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the other. I will conclude this affair, when I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that it appears from the Inſtitution of Baptiſm, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and end of it was to make Diſciples<note n="(m)" place="margin">Matt. 28.19.</note> unto Chriſt. For it appearing from other words of his, that they, and they alone can be his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> who <hi>take up their Croſs</hi>

                        <hi>in his words;</hi> If the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and end of Baptiſm were to make men Diſciples unto Chriſt, it muſt conſequently oblige thoſe, who take it upon them, to take upon them alſo the performance of the other, as to which that Diſcipleſhip obligeth them.</p>
                     <p>Now though therefore there can be no great doubt concerning the baptized perſon's making profeſſion of acting agreeably to the Laws of Chriſt, yet there may be as to the meaſure of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to them, to which his Baptiſmal Profeſſion obligeth him; That imperfect ſtate, wherein we are, and the baptized perſon's being from the beginning<note n="(q)" place="margin">Expl. of the Lords Prayer in the words, <hi>Our Father,</hi> &amp;c.</note> taught to pray <hi>for the forgiveneſs of his Treſpaſſes</hi> ſeeming to require an abatement of it; And becauſe too I have more than once oblig'd my ſelf to enquire, what <hi>keeping of God's holy Will, and Commandments,</hi> is incumbent upon us from our Baptiſmal Profeſſion, and that Chriſtianity, which it enters us into; Therefore for the farther clearing this part of our Baptiſmal Profeſſion, as well as for the anſwering my own obligations, I will now ſet my ſelf to enquire, what the <hi>meaſure</hi> of that conformity is, which we <hi>profeſs</hi> to pay to the Laws of Chriſt, and what are the <hi>conſequence of the violation of that Profeſſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As concerning the <hi>former</hi> of theſe I ſhall not doubt to affirm it to be adaequate for the matter of it to the ſeveral <hi>ſpecies</hi> of thoſe Laws, which Chriſtianity obligeth us to; S. <hi>Paul</hi> having expreſly told us<note n="(r)" place="margin">Tit. 2.11, 12.</note>, that that <hi>Grace, which bringeth ſalvation, teacheth men to deny all ungodly, and worldly luſts, and to live righteouſly, godlily and ſoberly in the preſent World.</hi> I ſhall not ſtick to affirm, Secondly, that that Conformity, which we make profeſſion of, ought to anſwer ſo far as we can carry it, the ſeveral <hi>particularities</hi> of the Chriſtian Laws, as well as the ſeveral ſpecies thereof: Leſs than that being not to be ſuppos'd to be the Profeſſion of thoſe, who make profeſſion of a good Conſcience toward God; A good Conſcience, as ſuch, prompting him in whom it is to conform ſo far as he can to every particular of his Law, to whom he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth an obedience. But neither Thirdly ſhall I ſtick to affirm, that that conformity, which we make profeſſion of, ought to be ſo entire, and full, as not to be interrupted at any time by a <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful violation</hi> of any Law, or a violation of them in <hi>ſcandalous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances;</hi> Such as thoſe are, concerning which S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd<note n="(ſ)" place="margin">Gal. 5.21.</note>, that <hi>they, which do ſuch things, ſhall not inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God:</hi> He anſwering not the divine law, ſo far as he can, who proceeds to either of thoſe, becauſe the Grace of Baptiſm, with a moderate care, muſt be ſuppos'd to be of ſufficient force to preſerve men both from the one, and the other. Such I take to be the Conformity, which Chriſtianity obligeth us to, and which conſequently the baptized perſon muſt be ſuppos'd to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of. And I would to God, that as all Chriſtians make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56517:91"/>of ſuch a one, ſo their lives, and converſations were more anſwerable to it, than the experience both of our ſelves and others aſſures us it is. But as the contrary thereof is too apparent to need any farther proof, ſo I think it therefore but reaſonable, for the better awaking of thoſe baptized ones, to ſet before them in the next place the <hi>conſequences of the violation of their profeſſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whereof the firſt, that I ſhall aſſign, is, that ſo far as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from that Profeſſion of theirs, ſo far forth they ſin againſt that very Baptiſm of theirs, which was intended for their recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from ſin, and againſt that ſaving Religion, into which it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits them: That Baptiſm, which enjoyns upon them the making profeſſion of a good Conſcience, enjoyning conſequently the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering that profeſſion by a ſutable piety, as without which that Profeſſion would be but an hypocritical one. From whence as it will follow, that there will be little reaſon to believe, that they ſhall enjoy the benefits of Baptiſm, who anſwer not the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it; So much leſs if we conſider what that was, that made their Profeſſion to be of any avail at the firſt, even the <hi>preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> it gave, that the perſon, that made it, would (as occaſion offer'd it ſelf) give ſutable demonſtrations of it. For if that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption were the thing, which made the Profeſſion of a good Conſcience to be of any avail at the firſt; Thoſe demonſtrations failing, thoſe benefits muſt be ſuppos'd to fail, which were colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the preſumption of them. But from thence it will follow Thirdly, that they, who anſwer not their former profeſſion, can much leſs promiſe to themſelves farther ſpiritual bleſſings here, or an intereſt in the other World; They, who could not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the firſt priviledges of Baptiſm but upon a preſumption of their future piety, being much leſs likely to be admitted to the participation of others, after that preſumption appeareth to be null. It will follow Laſtly, that they who anſwer not the Profeſſion of Baptiſm by a piety ſutable to it, muſt conſequently fail altogether of the benefits thereof, if that Chriſtianity, into which it entred them, had not provided them of a remedy againſt the violations of their Profeſſion. Which, though it will not make the caſe of thoſe violators deſperate, yet will ſhew it to be ſo dangerous, as to oblige all, who have a care of their Salvation, to prevent what they may ſuch violations of it, or endeavour to repair them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by a ſpeedy, and ſevere repentance, and a more fixed, and ſetled piety: Leſt, as it may ſome time happen, they be cut off before they can make uſe of the remedy propos'd, or by reaſon of their former violations have not the grace given them to do it.</p>

The two firſt of theſe ſpoken to here, and firſt, Whether Baptiſm ought to be expreſly adminiſtred in the form propos'd. Which is not only ſhewn to be under obligation from the expreſs words of the Inſtitution, but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer made to thoſe Texts, which ſeem to intimate it to be enough to baptize in the name of the Lord Jeſus only. The Baptiſm of Schiſmaticks, and Hereticks more largely ſhewn to be valid, unleſs where they baptize into a counterfeit <hi>Faith,</hi> and the ſeveral <hi>obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> againſt it anſwer'd.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have hitherto entreated of the <hi>outward viſible ſign</hi> of Baptiſm, of its <hi>inward and ſpiritual Grace,</hi> or the things ſignified by it, and the <hi>farther rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> that outward ſign beareth to them.

                     <p>Now as the <hi>Foundation</hi> of that relation hath been ſhewn<note n="*" place="margin">Expl. of the Sacrament in general, Part 2.</note> to be no other, than the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of Chriſt, as that again not ſo much as deliver'd by him, as appli'd to that <hi>water</hi> in which it is ſubjected; So I have in the ſame diſcourſe ſaid<note n="†" place="margin">

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56517:93"/>ſay the leſs here. It may ſuffice briefly to obſerve from thence, that what the Miniſter hath prepar'd the water of Baptiſm by a declaration of the end of its Inſtitution, and by imploring the Holy Spirit on it, Chriſt, who hath promiſed to be with him in that miniſtration of his, gives it the relation of the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and conſequently makes it apt to convey the ſeveral graces thereof to thoſe, who are to partake of it. Which will leave lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more for us to conſider, as to the Sacrament of Baptiſm, than the right Adminiſtration of it, or what may without any violence be reduced to it.</p>
                     <p>Now there are <hi>Four</hi> things, which are eſpecially to be enquir'd in order to the clearing of that, which is now before us.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>I. Whether Baptiſm ought expreſly to be adminiſter'd in the name of the <hi>Father,</hi> and of the <hi>Son,</hi> and of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi>

                     </list>
                     <p n="1">I. The ground of the firſt of theſe, even whether Baptiſm ought expreſly to be adminiſtred <hi>in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> is not any the leaſt doubt of thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the expreſs words of the Inſtitution, or of their not admitting, conſider'd in themſelves, of any variation from it, but the accounts we have from the Scripture of the adminiſtration of that Sacrament either by the hands, or at the command of the Apoſtles, and other ſuch inſpired men: Thoſe ſeeming to intimate it to be enough to baptize <hi>in the name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> as comprehending within it an acknowledgement of the other two perſons, and indeed of all other the ſubſtantial Articles of his Faith, in whoſe name we are ſo baptiz'd. For thus when thoſe <hi>Jews,</hi> to whom S. <hi>Peter</hi> Preach'd on the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> were wrought upon ſo far, as to ask what they ought to do in order to their Salvation; S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s anſwer was<note n="†" place="margin">Acts 2.38.</note> that they ſhould be <hi>baptiz'd in the name of the Lord Jeſus:</hi> Which accordingly we may believe to have been done by thoſe, that <hi>gladly receiv'd the word,</hi> becauſe it is afterwards<note n="(a)" place="margin">Acts 2.41.</note> ſaid of them, that <hi>they were baptiz'd,</hi> that is, as one would think, in that, and that only name, which had been preſcrib'd. Thus again it is ſaid<note n="(b)" place="margin">Acts 8.16.</note> of thoſe, who had been baptiz'd by <hi>Philip</hi> at <hi>Samaria,</hi> that they were <hi>baptiz'd in the name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> without any the leaſt hint of their being baptized in any <hi>other name:</hi> As in like manner<note n="(c)" place="margin">Acts 10.47.</note>, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> gave order for the baptizing of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, after that the Holy Ghoſt had by his preaching deſcended upon them. In fine thus we find, that the Diſciples of <hi>Epheſus</hi>
                        <note n="(d)" place="margin">Acts 19.5.</note> were, who it ſeems till that time had not only no gifts of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt upon them, but not ſo much as any knowledge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there were any Holy Ghoſt, or no. Which place is the more to be ſtood upon, becauſe thoſe Diſciples having before ſo little knowledge of a Holy Ghoſt, one would think he that told the ſtory of their taking upon them the Chriſtian Baptiſm at the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56517:93"/>of what was ſaid to them by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſhould have expreſs'd that Baptiſm of theirs by their being baptiz'd into the belief of the Trinity, and particularly of that <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which they ſeem before to have been ignorant of. But as we are not lightly to think, nor indeed without an irrefragable reaſon, that thoſe firſt Diſciples of Chriſt made uſe of, or countenanc'd any other form of Baptiſm, than what their Maſter had ſo clearly, and expreſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd; So there is nothing of any ſuch moment in the places before alledg'd to perſuade their making uſe of, or giving coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to any other. On the contrary the Text laſt mention'd, if taken in all its parts, ſeems rather to perſuade thoſe Diſciples having been baptiz'd in the very words of the Inſtitution, than only <hi>in the name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> For S. <hi>Paul</hi> asking, as by way of wonderment, unto what they had been before baptiz'd, if they had not (as they ſaid) ſo much as heard of any Holy Ghoſt, ſeems to intimate that all, that then receiv'd the Chriſtian Baptiſm, could not but know from the very form of it, that there was ſuch a thing as a Holy Ghoſt. Neither will it avail to ſay, as was before objected, that if that had been S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s intention, or the certain form of Baptiſm, S. <hi>Luke,</hi> who tells the ſtory, ſhould in reaſon have expreſs'd it by their being baptiz'd into the Trinity, and particularly into the name of him, whom they were before ſo ignorant of. Becauſe S. <hi>Luke</hi>'s buſineſs was not ſo much to give an account of the form of their Baptiſm, as to acquaint us, that whereas before they had been only baptiz'd into <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm, upon their underſtanding from S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>John</hi> himſelf directed thoſe, that came to it, <hi>to believe on him that ſhould come after him, that is on Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> they were then expreſly baptiz'd into the Baptiſm of Chriſt, or (as S. <hi>Luke</hi> there expreſſeth it) into the name of Jeſus Chriſt: So oppoſing the baptizing <hi>into the name of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> not to the baptizing in any other form, and particularly into the name of all the three perſons, but to the Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and as the name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> might diſcriminate their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Baptiſm from it. And though it be true, that the like is not to be ſaid as to the foregoing Texts, becauſe there is no oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in them between the Baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> and that of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Yet may a fair account be given, without ſuppoſing that to have been the form of Baptiſm, of the Scriptures expreſſing thoſe primitive Baptiſms by baptizing into the <hi>name of Jeſus</hi> only; Becauſe our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was the immediate Author of that Religion, into which thoſe Baptiſms were made, and the baptizing <hi>into his name</hi> therefore no improper expreſſion of a baptizing into the whole of it, and into every part, and particle thereof. I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this affair, when I have added that as it appears from <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi>

                        </note>, into which Baptiſm is requir'd to be made, and conſequently muſt be ſuppos'd to baptize into a falſe, and counterfeit one. But how little force there is in theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, as to the invalidating the Baptiſm of Schiſmaticks, or Hereticks, will appear upon a more narrow inſpection into them.</p>
                     <p>For be it firſt that Schiſmaticks and Hereticks are by that Schiſm, or Hereſie of theirs deprived of the Spirit of God themſelves; Be it that they cannot therefore be ſuppos'd to conferr it upon others: Yet will it not from thence follow, but they may be valid Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtratours of Baptiſm, and they, who receive it from them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Spirit of God with it. Becauſe that Spirit of God, which goes along with Baptiſm, is not conferred by them, but by him, whoſe Inſtitution Baptiſm is, and conſequently no way depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon their having the Spirit of God themſelves. All, that the Miniſter confers on his part toward the procuring of that Spirit, is to prepare that Baptiſmal Water, which it is by the Inſtitution of Chriſt to accompany, and to adminiſter it, when ſo prepar'd, to thoſe who are to be baptized with it. Which if the Miniſter doth according to the Inſtitution of Chriſt, there is no doubt the Spirit of God will follow of courſe, whether he, who adminiſters Baptiſm, partake of that Spirit, or no. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a ſinful Miniſter would be as invalid an Adminiſtrator of Baptiſm, as the moſt Schiſmatical, or Heretical one.</p>
                     <p>But it may be there is more of weight in Schiſmaticks, and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks being <hi>out of the Church,</hi> and as ſuch in no condition either of enjoying in themſelves thoſe priviledges, that belong to it, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtrumental toward the procuring of them for others. And ſo no doubt there would, if they were fully, and perfectly out of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56517:94"/>the Church, nor retain'd in any meaſure to it. But how firſt, if Schiſmaticks, and Hereticks were fully, and perfectly out of the Church, could S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>

                        </note> himſelf allow the receiving of ſuch without a new Baptiſm, who had after their Baptiſm in the Church fallen into Schiſm, or Hereſie? Theſe, as they were no leſs Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, and Hereticks than thoſe, that were baptiz'd by Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and conſequently alike out of the Church; So being, if to be receiv'd again, to be receiv'd after the ſame manner, that is to ſay by a new Baptiſm. Neither will it avail to ſay (as that <hi>Father</hi>
                        <note n="(f)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> pleads for himſelf) that thoſe, who have been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd in the Church, are to be look'd upon as <hi>wandring ſheep,</hi> and as ſuch, when they return, to be receiv'd into the Fold, whereas the other are wholly <hi>aliens,</hi> and <hi>profane.</hi> For if Schiſmaticks, and Hereticks be fully, and perfectly out of the Church, thoſe alſo, what ever they before were, muſt ceaſe to be look'd upon as Sheep, and conſequently, if admitted, be admitted as <hi>aliens,</hi> and <hi>profane,</hi> as well as thoſe, who were baptiz'd out of the Church.

                        </note>, that thoſe who oppos'd him, and the Biſhops that took part with him, argued the validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Baptiſm of Hereticks from the Churches receiving thoſe without a new one, who had fallen after her Baptiſm into Schiſm or Hereſie; So if we will allow the Baptiſm of the latter, we muſt allow the Baptiſm of the former, or find out ſome other reaſon to overthrow it. For if the rightly baptized Schiſmatick, or Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick were a <hi>Sheep,</hi> though a <hi>wandring</hi> one, notwithſtanding his Schiſm, or Hereſie; The Schiſmatick, or Heretick, whom that <hi>wandring Sheep</hi> ran after, might as well be a <hi>Paſtor,</hi> though a <hi>wandring</hi> one too, and conſequently be in a condition, following the order of the Inſtitution, to bring new Sheep to the great Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, and Biſhop of our Souls. That, which I ſuppoſe occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd that <hi>Father</hi>'s miſtake (for ſo I hope I may now have leave to call it, becauſe the Church of God hath generally done ſo ſince) but that I ſay, which occaſion'd S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s miſtake, was his not diſtinguiſhing between being fully, and perfectly out of the Church (which I ſhould think none but Apoſtates can be, if they alſo are) and being only partly, and imperfectly ſo, as Schiſmaticks, and Hereticks are. For as Schiſmaticks, and Hereticks muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to retain ſo far to the Church, as they do not ſeparate from it in Communion, or belief; So it is but a juſt piece of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to think that Chriſt who knows men's infirmities, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, will not invalidate ſuch acts of theirs, as are purely cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable ones, and wherein moreover they conſent with the Church of God (whatever they may do as to other things) and with his his own bleſſed Inſtitution. I deny not indeed, but that to be even ſo out of the Church, as Schiſmaticks, and Hereticks are, is a very dangerous thing, and doth without a ſpecial mercy of God make them liable to Damnation. But as I do not therefore think, that we ought to look upon it as a deſperate one; So there may be ſo much of honeſt ſimplicity of mind even in them, and a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to embrace the truth, whenſoever they are convinced of it, that Chriſt, who laid down his life for the worſt of men, may ſo far at leaſt conſider them, as to give his bleſſing to thoſe acts of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56517:95"/>theirs, which are both charitable in themſelves, and manag'd with a juſt conſent to his own inſtitution, and the practice too of that Church, from which in other things they have departed.</p>
                     <p>And this anſwer, with a little variation, will furniſh one to that objection, which repreſents Schiſmaticks and Hereticks as <hi>ſinners</hi> before God, and whom therefore we cannot ſuppoſe God will hear for the perſon to be baptiz'd. For though I grant that ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are ſinners before God, yea that whatever they do by way of ſeparation from the Church, is to be look'd upon as of the ſame nature, and conſequently that their very baptizing alſo may be; Yet as I do not think that every thing, that is ſinfully done, is therefore invalid (for ſo for ought I know many true Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens good actions alſo might be) So Chriſt may hear even ſuch perſons, when they act agreeably to his own Inſtitution, both for the regard he bears to that, and for that honeſt ſimplicity, and good meaning, which is, if not in them that adminiſter Baptiſm, yet in thoſe that joyn with them, and whoſe Miniſter I have before ſaid<note n="(h)" place="margin">Expl. of the Sacram. in gen. Part 3</note> the Conſecratour to be in that affair.</p>
                     <p>One only Objection remains on the part of Hereticks, and that is their depraving that Faith, into which Baptiſm is requir'd to be made, and conſequently thereto, as is ſuppos'd, baptizing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a falſe, and counterfeit one. And I no way doubt that, if He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks baptize into a falſe, and counterfeit Faith, their Baptiſm is null, becauſe contrary to that Inſtitution, which gives validity to all. Upon which account we muſt look upon the Baptiſm of thoſe perſons as null, who have baptiz'd in any other form, than in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt. Of which ſort was that of the Hereticks ſpoken of by <hi>Irenaeus</hi>
                        <note n="(i)" place="margin">Adv. Haereſ. li. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>18.</hi>
                        </note>, who inſtead of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing according to the form of the inſtitution, did baptize their Diſciples <hi>into the name of the unknown Father of all things, into truth the Mother of all things, into him that deſcended into Jeſus for the union, and redemption, and communion of powers.</hi> To which others it ſeems added certain <hi>Hebrew</hi> names, the better to amuſe thoſe, that were initiated by them. The like may reaſonably enough be thought of the Baptiſm of many other of the Antient <hi>Hereticks,</hi> although we have not it may be ſo certain grounds from Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for their depraving the very form of Baptiſm. For being, as appears from their tenents, Chriſtians in name, rather than in reality, and beſide that advancing ſuch uncouth, and monſtrous ones, it is not eaſie to think they ſhould have ſuch a regard to Chriſt, or his Inſtitution, as to keep to that form, which he preſcrib'd.

And to ſpeak my mind freely, though with ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to better judgments, I conceive ſuch Hereticks may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd to do it, who advance a Hereſie, that directly, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly contradicts the Faith of Baptiſm, and particularly the Faith of the Holy Trinity. Which I do in part upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council<note n="(l)" place="margin">Can. 19.</note>, and in part alſo upon the Authority of Reaſon. For though there be not the leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, that the followers of <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus</hi> made uſe of any other form of Baptiſm, than the Catholicks did; Though there be ſome preſumption on the contrary, that they made uſe of the very ſame form, becauſe though they deny'd a Trinity of Perſons, yet they aſſerted one, and the ſame God to be rightly entitled by the names of Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; Yet did the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council notwithſtanding, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their direct, and manifeſt denial of the Trinity, and their affirming Chriſt to be a meer Man) ſo far diſallow their Baptiſm, as to require the reiteration of it. As indeed why ſhould it not, when thoſe <hi>Paulianiſts</hi> did ſo directly and manifeſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the ſenſe of that form, whereby they pretended to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed? That direct, and manifeſt contradiction of theirs proclam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the World, that though they baptiz'd in the ſame form of words with the Orthodox, yet in a perfectly different ſenſe, and conſequently departed alike from that Inſtitution, which was to give force to it. I ſay not the ſame of the Baptiſm of the <hi>Arians,</hi> where they made uſe of the ſame form of words, which the Inſtitution pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd, as it is certain that many<note n="*" place="margin">De Arianis, qui propriâ ſua lege utuntur, ut baptizentur placuit.

Which ſuppos'd, what ſhould hinder Chriſt from giving force to that Baptiſm which is ſo adminiſtred by them? Theſe, as they do not at all vary from the Inſtitution of Chriſt, ſo in this particular, even in the application of the Baptiſmal water to the Baptized parties, acting not in their own, or in their peoples names, but in the name of Chriſt, and who therefore may the rather be ſuppoſed to give force and vertue to it. The reſult of the premiſes is this.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56517:96"/>A Heretick is indeed oblig'd to baptize into the truly Chriſtian Faith, neither can any man otherwiſe promiſe force from that act of his. But if he baptize into that faith (as he may even whilſt he continues ſuch) his Baptiſm is valid, neither can any man doubt of a bleſſing from it, who comes prepared for it, and, when he comes to know in what company he hath been engag'd, renounceth that, and their Hereſie, and both ſubmits himſelf to the diſcipline of the Church, and keeps to the communion of it.</p>

                     <p>That I give the precedency to thoſe of riper years, though ſuch Baptiſms as thoſe are little known among us, is becauſe there is no doubt Baptiſm began with them, and could not indeed have found any other entrance into the World; The Baptiſm of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, in the opinion of thoſe, who do moſt ſtrongly aſſert it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon the Baptiſm of their Parents, or of thoſe, who are in the place of them. Of whom, if ſome had not been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd in their riper years, thoſe Infants, that claimed by them,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56517:97"/>could not with reaſon have pretended to it. Of thoſe of riper years therefore I mean firſt to entreat, and ſhew to <hi>what,</hi> and <hi>what kind</hi> of perſons among them the Sacrament of Baptiſm ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred.</p>
                     <p>Now as it is clear from our Saviour's injunction<note n="*" place="margin">Matt. 28.19.</note> of <hi>diſcipling,</hi> and <hi>baptizing</hi> all Nations, that none of what condition ſoever are to be excluded from it, who are qualified, as Chriſtianity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, for the receiving of it; So the only thing therefore farther neceſſary to be enquir'd into on this Head, is how men ought to be <hi>qualified</hi> for it, or (as our <hi>Catechiſm</hi> expreſſeth it) what is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired</hi> of them. For ſuppoſing thoſe <hi>praerequiſites</hi> of Baptiſm, he who enjoyns the <hi>diſcipling,</hi> and baptizing all Nations, muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be ſuppos'd to enjoyn the adminiſtring of it to all ſuch, in whom thoſe <hi>praerequiſites</hi> are.</p>
                     <p>Now there are two things again, as our <hi>Catechiſm</hi> inſtructs us, which are requir'd of all thoſe, that are to be baptized; <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> whereby they forſake ſin, and <hi>Faith,</hi> whereby they ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe the promiſes made to them in that Sacrament. And for theſe two things at leaſt it hath the aſtipulation of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and I may add alſo of that <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> which is made by the bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed perſon in Baptiſm, and which having before eſtabliſh'd, I may now the more ſecurely argue from. Witneſs, for the <hi>Scripture,</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s<note n="†" place="margin">Acts 2.38.</note> enjoyning thoſe <hi>Jews,</hi> (who demanded of him, and the reſt, what they ought to do in order to their ſalvation) to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and</hi> ſo <hi>be baptiz'd in the name of the Lord Jeſus;</hi> And <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>'s replying upon the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> who ask'd <hi>what did hinder him to be baptiz'd,</hi> that <hi>if he believ'd</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 8.37.</note> 
                        <hi>with all his heart, he might:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by more than intimating that, if he did not, he could not be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd at all, though all other things concurred to the receiving of it. And indeed, what leſs can be ſuppos'd to be requir'd of ſuch perſons, when (as was before<note n="†" place="margin">Expl. of Bapt.

That Profeſſion of his ſuppoſing Repentance, and Faith to have been before in him, as without which otherwiſe he could not there make a ſincere Profeſſion of renouncing ſin, or of believing in the name of the Lord Jeſus. But ſo (that I may add that by the way) the Antient Church appears to have requir'd, before ſhe admitted, men to the participation of Baptiſm; <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> where he profeſſeth to give a ſincere account of her doings in this affair, telling thoſe he wrote his <hi>Apology</hi> to, that <hi>ſuch as were perſuaded, and believ'd that the things taught and ſaid by the Chriſtians were true</hi>

                     <p>For the clearing of the <hi>firſt</hi> of which we are to know, that though <hi>Repentance,</hi> in ſtrict ſpeech, be nothing elſe than <hi>a ſorrow of mind for thoſe ſins we ſtand guilty of before God;</hi> Yet as even ſo it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſeth a right apprehenſion of thoſe ſins, as without which we could never be brought to a due ſorrow for them, ſo taking Repentance (as our <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> and the Scripture alſo ſometime doth) as one of the two prerequiſites of Baptiſm (For S. <hi>Paul</hi> in one place<note n="(b)" place="margin">Acts 20.21.</note> makes that Repentance, and Faith the <hi>ſum</hi> of his Preaching to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> and in another<note n="(c)" place="margin">Heb. 6.1.</note> the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> of our Chriſtianity) it will be found to imply in it what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever that ſorrow for ſin doth naturally diſpoſe men to, as well as that ſorrow it ſelf: The ſame S. <hi>Paul</hi> elſewhere profeſſing that he <hi>ſhewed both to the Jews, and Gentiles, that they ſhould turn unto God,</hi> as well as <hi>Repent;</hi> and <hi>do works meet for Repentance,</hi> as well as either. To attain therefore a due underſtanding of this Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as well as to clear that definition of it, which our Catechiſm hath given us, it will be neceſſary for us to enquire what this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance doth <hi>preſuppoſe,</hi> what it <hi>imports,</hi> and to what it doth <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That, which Repentance doth moſt manifeſtly preſuppoſe, is a right apprehenſion of that <hi>ſin,</hi> about which it is to be converſant; And may be fetch'd in part from the dictates of our own reaſon, but more eſpecially from the declarations of Chriſtianity concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. Such as are, that ſin is the tranſgreſſion of a Law, and particularly of that of God, and that, as ſuch, it juſtly expoſeth us to his wrath, and indignation: Partly, as it is a violation of his Authority, to whom we are naturally ſubject, and partly as an equal affront to his goodneſs, who gives us our being, and all things elſe, and who therefore ought more diligently to have been attended to. In fine, that it hath for its wages Death both tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and eternal, and under each of which, without the mercy of God in Chriſt, the ſinner muſt neceſſarily fall. For as theſe are known in part, from the dictates of our own reaſon to be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of that ſin, whereof we ſpeak; So they are much more known to be ſo from the Doctrine of Chriſtianity, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be known by us toward a right apprehenſion of that, which ought to be the matter of our ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>But from hence it will be eaſie to collect, what that ſorrow for ſin doth <hi>import,</hi> which is requir'd of all thoſe, that take upon them the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity. Even that it importeth ſuch a ſorrow of mind, as hath a regard to the violation of God's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Goodneſs by it, as well as to the evils which are like to ariſe to it from our ſelves; Our ſorrow being in reaſon to be ſuited to that, which is moſt conſiderable in the object of it. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as otherwiſe it will be rather a ſorrow for puniſhment, than ſin, becauſe ſin, as ſuch, is a tranſgreſſion of God's Law, and conſequently our ſorrow for it to have a more eſpecial regard to the affront, that is offer'd him thereby; So it will much leſs deſerve thoſe titles, which are given it by the Scripture of being a ſorrow, or <hi>repentance toward</hi>

                        <hi>according to God,</hi> or a <hi>Godly</hi> one, as it alſo is: That being neither <hi>toward God,</hi> nor <hi>according to God,</hi> which hath not a
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56517:98"/>regard to that affront, which is offer'd to him by ſin, as well as to the evils, which are like to accrue unto our ſelves.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe even ſuch a ſorrow will not qualifie us for Baptiſm, unleſs we add thereto what the ſame ſorrow doth <hi>naturally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi> us to; Therefore to make out more fully the true nature of Repentance, as well as to clear our Churches definition of it, I will proceed to that, and ſhew what thoſe things are. Of which nature I reckon firſt an ingenuous <hi>confeſſion of ſin,</hi> and earneſt <hi>prayer</hi> to God for the pardon of it; Sorrow for ſin, when conſidered only with reference to its appendant puniſhment, being likely enough to diſpoſe us ſo to confeſs, and ask pardon of it, if it were only to unburthen our ſelves, and free our ſelves by that, and prayer from the puniſhment we have deſerv'd. How much more then, when conſider'd as a ſorrow for that affront, which we have by means of our ſin offer'd to God's both Authority, and Goodneſs? He, to whom ſuch an affront is matter of ſorrow, being likely enough to be thereby diſpos'd ſo far to acknowledge that Authority, and goodneſs, as to own them upon the poſtfact by confeſſion, and prayer for pardon: He who <hi>confeſſeth,</hi> and <hi>asketh pardon</hi> of God, acknowledging that God had, and hath an Authority to command, and puniſh him, as he, who doth the <hi>latter,</hi> that God is of equal goodneſs, as of whom otherwiſe it would be in vain for him to ask pardon for his offences. Whence it was, that when the Church proceeded by ſtrict, and ſafe meaſures, ſhe not only taught thoſe, that offer'd themſelves to Baptiſm, <hi>to ask of God with faſting the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs</hi> of their forepaſt offences, but (as we learn from <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi>

I reckon of the ſame nature ſecondly, a <hi>reſolution to forſake ſin,</hi> and purſue the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vertues. Which I do not only upon the Authority of the foremention'd <hi>Father,</hi> who reckons that<note n="(g)" place="margin">Loco prius citato.</note> 
                        <hi>alſo</hi> as a prerequiſite to Baptiſm, but as it is a thing, to which ſorrow for ſin, doth alike naturally diſpoſe us; He, to whom ſin is ſo irkſome, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other motive, than that irkſomeneſs, to oblige him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake it, and pay a more perfect ſubmiſſion to that Authority, and goodneſs of God, which he hath before ſo ſhamefully violated. I reckon thirdly, as a thing, to which ſorrow for ſin doth equally diſpoſe us, a <hi>preſent forſaking</hi> of thoſe ſins, which we are under a temptation to commit, as well as a reſolution to do ſo for the time to come; There being the ſame force in a due ſorrow for ſin to diſpoſe men to that, as there is to a reſolution of afterward for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking it. For which cauſe the Antient Church did not only refuſe ſuch perſons Baptiſm, as were of any <hi>unlawful Profeſſion</hi>

They finding no doubt by manifold experience, that many that offer'd themſelves to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, made little Conſcience afterward of avoiding thoſe ſins, which they had before ſo ſolemnly reſolv'd againſt, and made publick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of abandoning. And though it do not appear, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles themſelves took this courſe, they baptizing men immediately upon the bare profeſſion of their Repentance, and a reſolution after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56517:98"/>to bring forth fruits meet for it: Yet as the reaſon of that poſſibly might be, either becauſe of that exuberance of Grace, which was then beſtow'd upon their new Converts, or becauſe, by means of their Ambulatory life, they could not well deferr the Baptiſm of thoſe, that offer'd themſelves, till they had made ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable trial of them (which will exempt ſuch Churches from their example, where there is no ſuch exuberance of Grace, and where moreover they have ſetled Paſtors to intend the affairs of them) So we cannot think the Apoſtles would have ever given Baptiſm to ſuch perſons, as ſhould before that Baptiſm of theirs have fallen into thoſe ſins, which they erewhile made profeſſion of abandoning: Sorrow for ſin, where it is hearty, and real, no doubt diſpoſing men as well to a preſent forſaking of it, as it doth to a reſolution concerning it. Which will make the <hi>Repentance</hi> pre-required to Baptiſm to be (as our <hi>Catechiſm</hi> expreſſeth it) a <hi>Repentance,</hi> whereby as occaſion offers, <hi>we</hi> actually <hi>forſake ſin,</hi> as well as reſolve for the future to abandon it.</p>
                     <p>An account being thus given of the <hi>firſt</hi> thing pre-requir'd to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; and our Churches definition of it both explain'd, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; Paſs we on to that, which is alike pre-required to it, even that <hi>Faith,</hi> whereby we ſtedfaſtly believe the promiſes made to us in that Sacrament.

It pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſeth again <hi>as to Chriſt,</hi> in whom all the promiſes of God are Yea, and <hi>Amen,</hi> a like ſtedfaſt belief that there was ſuch a perſon as Jeſus Chriſt, and that he was appointed by God to convey ſuch graces to us; That, agreeably to the predictions of the Scripture, and the will of God concerning him, he took upon him our nature, and ſuffer'd in it to purchaſe thoſe Graces, and that he ever ſince intends the exhibiting of what he hath ſo purchas'd; The belief of theſe, and the like Articles of our Faith being as manifeſtly preſuppos'd to the belief of thoſe Promiſes, which in this place we are required to intend.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. That which will it may be more concern us to enquire, is what our <hi>Catechiſm</hi> means by a <hi>ſtedfaſt belief</hi> of them. For my more orderly reſolution whereof I will enquire firſt what it means by <hi>belief,</hi> and then by a <hi>ſtedfaſt</hi> one.</p>
                     <p>Now by belief may be meant either a <hi>ſimple aſſent of the mind,</hi> and in which fenſe there is no doubt it is oftentimes taken in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Writers; Or there may be meant alſo a belief with affiance, and ſuch as beſide the aſſent of the mind, or underſtanding to them, doth alſo connote a truſt in them, or in God becauſe of them. By vertue of which (as I have elſewhere diſcours'd<note n="(k)" place="margin">Expl. of the Decal. Com. 1. Part 3.</note> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the grace of truſt) the heart, or will is prompted to deſire, as well as aſſent to the matter of the divine promiſes, and acquieſce in thoſe for the obtaining of it. And indeed if we may judge any thing by our <hi>Homilies,</hi> (to which the Articles<note n="(l)" place="margin">Art. 11.</note> of our Church do alſo particularly referr us in the point of juſtifying Faith) this latter belief muſt be here intended; Becauſe a belief, which hath for its end the remiſſion of ſins in Baptiſm, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently a juſtifying one. For <hi>the right, and true Chriſtian</hi> Faith (ſaith one of our<note n="(m)" place="margin">Homily of Salvation. Part 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Homilies</hi>) <hi>is not only to believe that the Holy Scripture, and all the</hi> forecited <hi>Articles of our Faith, are true, but alſo to have a ſure truſt, and confidence in God's merciful promiſes to be ſaved from everlaſting damnation by Chriſt.</hi> And <hi>it is not only,</hi> ſaith another<note n="(n)" place="margin">Hom. of Faith.</note>, <hi>the common belief of the Articles of our Faith, but it is alſo a ſure truſt, and confidence of the mercy of God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and a ſtedfaſt hope of all good things to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd at God's hands.</hi> In fine, ſaith the ſame<note n="(o)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> Homily, <hi>the very ſure, lively Chriſtian faith is not only to believe all things of God, which are contained in holy Scripture, but alſo to have an earneſt truſt, and confidence in God,</hi> &amp;c. Which ſuppos'd (as we may, becauſe we can have no more <hi>Authentick</hi> interpretation of it) to be the ſenſe of the <hi>belief</hi> here intended, it will not be difficult to ſhew, what our <hi>Catechiſm</hi> means by a <hi>ſtedfaſt</hi> one.</p>
                     <p>For conſidering the belief of theſe Promiſes as an Aſſent of the mind to them, ſo a ſtedfaſt belief will imply that, which is free
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56517:99"/>from all doubts, and which the mind of man gives to thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes without any the leaſt fear of there being any Colluſion in them; Which the mind of man may well give, conſidering whoſe thoſe Promiſes are, and that they have both God, and Chriſt for the Authors of them. On the other ſide, if we conſider the belief intended as <hi>including</hi> in it alſo an <hi>affiance,</hi> or <hi>truſt,</hi> and by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of which the <hi>heart,</hi> or <hi>will</hi> is prompted to deſire, as well as believe the matter of thoſe Promiſes, and acquieſce in thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes for the attaining of it; So this <hi>ſtedfaſt</hi> belief will alſo imply ſuch a one, as is firmly rooted in the <hi>heart,</hi> or <hi>will,</hi> and can no more be rooted out of it by the force of temptations, than the other by doubts, or ſcruples. And indeed, as I do not ſee how any other belief, than that, can anſwer ſuch glorious promiſes as are made to us in the Sacrament of Baptiſm; ſo I ſee as little reaſon to doubt,</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. What evidence there is of <hi>that</hi> being the Faith, or belief, which is pre-requir'd by Chriſtianity to the receiving of it. For though S. <hi>Luke</hi> may ſeem to intimate by the account he gives of the Baptiſm of the <hi>Samaritans</hi>
                        <note n="(p)" place="margin">Acts 8.12.</note>, that they were baptiz'd upon a ſimple belief of what <hi>Philip preach'd concerning the things of the Kingdom of God;</hi> Yet he doth much more clearly intimate after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that Chriſtianity requir'd another ſort of belief, and ſuch as was accompani'd with an adherence of the <hi>will</hi> unto them: He making it the condition of the Eunuch's Baptiſm afterward, that he ſhould believe <hi>with all his heart</hi>
                        <note n="(q)" place="margin">Acts 8.37.</note>; Which is an expreſſion, that in the language of the Scripture referrs rather to the <hi>will,</hi> and <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi> than to the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> but however cannot well be thought not to include them there, where the believing with <hi>all</hi> the heart is requir'd. And indeed, as I do not ſee, conſidering the Doctrine of our <hi>Firſt Reformers,</hi> why this notion of <hi>Faith</hi> ſhould be ſo exploded, as it ſeems to me lately to have been; As I do much leſs ſee why men ſhould ſo boyle at that <hi>Juſtification,</hi> which was wont to be attributed in an eſpecial manner to it: So, if I live to finiſh the work I am now upon, I will in a <hi>Comment</hi> upon the Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians</hi> (which I have almoſt gather'd ſufficient materials for) endeavour to clear both the one, and the other, that men may neither take occaſion from thence to diſcard good works as unneceſſary, nor yet ſtay themſelves upon any other, than the promiſes of Chriſt, and on which the holieſt men upon earth, when they have been approaching near God's tribunal, have found themſelves oblig'd to caſt themſelves. In the mean time a little to repreſs the youthful heats of thoſe, who can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbear ſmiling at ſuch <hi>antiquated</hi> notions, I will ſet before them the <hi>advice,</hi> which was order'd to be given to ſick perſons, when good works to be ſure were not without their juſt repute. It is among the Interrogatories, which are ſaid<note n="(r)" place="margin">Field of the Church, Append. to the 3d. Book p. 303.</note> to have been preſcrib'd by <hi>Anſelme</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and particularly after that, which prompts the Prieſt to ask, <hi>Doſt thou believe, that thou canſt not be ſav'd, but by the death of Chriſt,</hi> and the ſick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Anſwer, that <hi>he did ſo. Go too therefore</hi> (as the Prieſt was taught to proceed) <hi>and whilſt thy ſoul remaineth in thee, place thy
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56517:100"/>confidence in this death alone, and in no other thing, commit thy ſelf wholly to it, cover thy ſelf wholly with it, immerſe, fix, and wrap thy ſelf wholly in it. And if the Lord God will judge thee, ſay, I put the death of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt between me, and thy judgment, otherwiſe I contend not with thee. And if he ſay that thou art a ſinner, ſay, Lord I put the death of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt between me, and my ſins. If he ſay to thee thou haſt deſerv'd damnation, ſay, Lord, I put the death of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt between me, and my evil deſerts, and I offer the ſame death for that merit, which I ought to have had, and have not. If he continue as yet to ſay, that he is angry with thee, ſay, Lord, I oppoſe the death of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt between me, and thy diſpleaſure.</hi> Words, which ſhew what kind of <hi>Faith</hi> was ſometime thought to be a <hi>juſtifying</hi> one, and what ſtreſs was laid upon it, before ever <hi>Fanaticiſm,</hi> or any thing of that nature was heard of in the World.</p>

For had not the Church laid great ſtreſs upon that paſſage of the Scripture, why did not he, as the World hath ſince learn'd to do, wholly omit the mention of it, as a Text no way pertinent to the buſineſs of Infant-Baptiſm? Or, if he thought good to take notice of it, why did he not turn the force of it another way, and ſay, as others have, that nothing more was intended by it, than to let men know they muſt put on the property of little Children, if they meant to enter into Chriſt's Kingdom? For either of theſe certainly had been more proper, than what we find him to alledge <hi>in theſe words,</hi> as to the <hi>delaying</hi> of the Baptiſm of Infants. <hi>The Lord indeed ſaith, Forbid not Children to come unto me. Let them come therefore, when they are grown, let them come when they may learn, and when they may be taught whither they are to come. Let them be made Chriſtians, when they may be able to know Chriſt.</hi> For what is this to the purpoſe of our Saviour, who check'd his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples for hindering <hi>thoſe</hi> from coming to him, who were brought to him before they were in a <hi>condition</hi> to learn, who in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility were brought to him in their Parents arms, and were both taken by him into his own, and bleſſed by him even then? For if the Diſciples were check'd for going about to hinder ſuch Children, his meaning was that they ſhould ſuffer <hi>ſuch</hi> to come unto him, and not keep them back from coming, till they <hi>ceaſed</hi> to be <hi>ſuch.</hi> But of ſuch force it ſeems was that Text then thought, that ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply however muſt be made to it; Or the deference men had for the Church, that urged it, would have ſpoil'd his device of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying the Baptiſm of them, till they came of years. Which will make it ſo much the more reaſonable to enquire, what there is in the Text it ſelf, which might juſtifie the confidence of the one, or give occaſion to the impertinent anſwer of the other.</p>
                     <p>For the better diſcovery whereof we are to know, that when certain perſons not named, but it ſeems who look'd upon our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our as a man of God, brought their Children to Chriſt, that he might <hi>touch</hi> them, that is to ſay, as our Saviour expounded their meaning, that he might <hi>lay his hands upon them, and bleſs them;</hi> His Diſciples, whether as looking upon it as no way beſeeming their Maſter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern himſelf about Children,<note n="*" place="margin">Aret. in locum.

Eſt enim ratio cur arcendi a Chriſto non ſint: Quia talium eſt regnum coelorum, hoc eſt, ſunt haeredes vitae aeternae; ergo à Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſto, qui janua eſt ad vitam, non debent arceris Deinde cum talium ſit regnum dei, ergo horum magis eſt, ad quorum ſimilitudinem alii, ut ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiant, iidem redire debent.</note>, becauſe the Kingdom of God belong'd to ſuch as they: Thereby intimating, that even thoſe Children had a right unto it, and were not therefore to be hindred from coming to him, who was the way, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the gate into it. For if the Kingdom of God belong'd to ſuch as they, much more to thoſe Children, to whom elder perſons ought to become like, that they might be in a capacity of obtaining it. As indeed otherwiſe, what force is there in the reaſon alledg'd for the ſuffering, and no way forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding young Children to come unto him? For they, who have in <hi>purpoſe of heart</hi> what the other have only <hi>naturally,</hi> may both be invited to tend toward, and be poſſeſs'd of the Kingdom of Heaven, though the other be no way brought to Chriſt, nor receive any bleſſing from him. In as much as their humility, and innocency is the reſult of God's ſpirit, and of their own will, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently more likely to be acceptable, whereas the other's is only the reſult of their conſtitution, and age. And I cannot therefore but think, that the true reaſon of our Saviour's making uſe of the word <gap reason="foreign">

For it appearing from the premiſes, that Infants have a right to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, and upon, and by vertue of that right to be brought to Chriſt alſo; They muſt conſequently have a right alſo to thoſe <hi>means,</hi> which are by the ſame Chriſt appointed to put them into the poſſeſſion of his Kingdom. Which Baptiſm certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being, and ſo, that, ordinarily at leaſt, none can enter into that Kingdom without<note n="(b)" place="margin">Joh. 3.5.</note> being <hi>born again</hi> by it, it cannot without injuſtice be withheld from thoſe Children, to whom the other doth appertain. Neither will it avail to ſay, though the Objection be not to be deſpis'd, that by this rule our Saviour ſhould either him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf have baptiz'd, or order'd his Diſciples to baptize thoſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56517:102"/>that were now brought unto him for his bleſſing. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide that one Argument will not ſolve another, and much leſs hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the matter thereof from being true, or concluſive; There might be reaſon enough, though the premiſes be allow'd, for our Saviour's not baptizing, or requiring his Diſciples to baptize thoſe Children, who were now brought unto him for his bleſſing: Partly, upon the account of the incompetency of thoſe, that brought them, and who being not Diſciples themſelves, but as is probable, of the <hi>multitude</hi>
                        <note n="(c)" place="margin">Mark 10.1. Matt. 19.2.</note> that followed him, could not claim from our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, nor he ſo regularly beſtow Baptiſm upon their Children; And partly to let the World ſee, that he was not ti'd to any methods himſelf in the diſpenſing of the graces of that Kingdom. For that our Saviour, by that bleſſing which he gave them, gave thoſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <hi>rem Sacramenti,</hi> or the Graces of Baptiſm, and ſo ſhew'd yet more the title Children have to it, cannot well be doubted of by any, who ſhall conſider how zealous he was for their being brought to him, as that too upon the account of the title they had to the Kingdom of Heaven. For conſidering that zeal of his, and the ground of it, what can be more reaſonable than to think, that our Saviour agreeably thereto did by his bleſſing conferr upon them that Evangelical regeneration, which was to fit them for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, and without which conſidering the impurity of their nature, and the neceſſity of being thus born anew, they could not regularly obtain it. And I have been the more particular in deducing, and preſſing the preſent argument; Partly becauſe led thereto by the meer force of the Text it ſelf, and the Authority of the Church that imployed it, till by accident I fell upon thoſe things I have before quoted out of <hi>Aretius;</hi> And partly becauſe I think it a better ſervice to the Church of God to ſtrengthen one old Argument, than deviſe many new ones: Such a courſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the more reſpect to the Church's both opinion, and practice, as ſhewing it to proceed upon ſubſtantial Arguments, and ſuch as in themſelves are not lightly to be refus'd.</p>
                     <p>My <hi>ſecond</hi> Argument for the Baptiſm of Infants ſhall be taken from that <hi>holineſs,</hi> which S. <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <note n="(d)" place="margin">1 Cor. 7.14.</note> attributes to the <hi>Children of Chriſtian Parents</hi> (yea where only one of them is ſuch) upon the account of their deſcent from them. For S. <hi>Paul</hi> having before perſuaded the <hi>believing party</hi> to continue with the <hi>unbelieving one,</hi> ſuppoſing that <hi>unbelieving</hi> one to be as willing to continue with the believer, as a <hi>motive</hi> to the doing of it alledgeth, that the <hi>unbelieving</hi> party <hi>is ſanctified by the believing,</hi> and proves that <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification</hi> again by the <hi>holineſs of the Children,</hi> that come from them, as which otherwiſe thoſe Children could not have in them, but the <hi>contrary.</hi> Now I demand what that <hi>holineſs</hi> is, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſuppoſeth to be the property of thoſe, who come from ſuch a ſanctified couple, that is to ſay, whether an <hi>inward holineſs,</hi> or an <hi>outward</hi> one? If they, who would avoid the force of this Text as to the Baptiſm of Infants, ſay an <hi>inward</hi> holineſs, they ſay more than we deſire, or can with truth be affirmed, becauſe though <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin</hi> be traduc'd from the Parents, yet inward holineſs is not, as being the product of the Spirit of God, and his inſtrument Baptiſm. But if they do however attribute ſuch a holineſs to thoſe
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56517:102"/>Children, they ſay enough to evince, that Baptiſm ought not to be deny'd to them. For <hi>who</hi> (as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake<note n="(e)" place="margin">Acts 10.47.</note> upon another occaſion) <hi>can forbid</hi> the <hi>water</hi> of Baptiſm <hi>to thoſe, who have receiv'd the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as to be ſure all, that are internally holy, have? It remains therefore, that if the Children of ſuch matches be not <hi>internally</hi> holy, they are <hi>externally</hi> ſo, and that external holineſs therefore, if it may be, to be inveſtigated by us. Now I demand Firſt, what external holineſs can be imagin'd in thoſe Children, but ſuch by which they come to belong to God in a more peculiar manner, than the Children of other matches do? This being the nature of all things, that are externally holy, whether by the voluntary conſecration of men, or the Inſtitution, or choice of God. I demand ſecondly, ſuppoſing thoſe Children to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long more to God, than the Children of other matches, whether by their thus becoming the peculiar property of God, they may not be ſuppos'd to be more dear to him, than the Children of other matches are? Every one naturally having an affection to ſuch, as belong to him, ſuitably to that nearneſs, wherein they belong to him. I demand Thirdly, ſuppoſing the Children of ſuch matches to be more dear to God than the Children of others, whether we are not to think he will take a more particular care of them, than of others? The care of any perſon being always ſuitable to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection he bears to thoſe, who are the object of his care. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Fourthly, whether, ſuppoſing ſuch a particular care of the Children of ſuch matches, he will not take a more particular care of them as to their eternal welfare, than he doth of the Children of other men; All other care, without this, being of little value to the party cared for, and, beſide that (as experience ſhews) equally extended by God to the Children of other matches, as well as to the deſcendants of Chriſtians. I demand Fifthly, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing ſuch a particular care as to their eternal welfare, whether he will not alſo allow them more means toward the compaſſing of it, than he can be ſuppos'd to allow to the Children of other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents? All care, where it is reaſonable, and juſt, employing ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means to bring that care of its unto effect. Now what pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar means doth, or can God allow to the Children of Chriſtian Parents, as to the procuring of their eternal welfare, ſuppoſing them to die before they come of years, as the generality of them do, unleſs it be the Sacrament of Baptiſm? For as theſe, no more than other Children, are capable of the benefits of the Goſpel by the graces of Faith, and Repentance; So they have no other way therefore, ſave the Sacrament of Baptiſm, either to be deliver'd from the guilt of Original Sin, or enſtated in Chriſts heavenly Kingdom. I conclude therefore, that the Children of Chriſtian Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, or of either of them being holy, they do by that holineſs of theirs acquire a right to a greater holineſs, I mean the holineſs of Baptiſm. And indeed however <hi>Tertullian</hi> could in his book<note n="(f)" place="margin">Cap. <hi>18.</hi>

Which as it is the holineſs, that I have been all along enforcing, and endeavouring to evince from thence Children's right unto another; So of what force it is toward the inferring of it, will need no other light, than that, which we have from <hi>Tertullian.</hi> For with what face can any man deny them the <hi>holineſs</hi> of Baptiſm, who are <hi>deſign'd,</hi> or mark'd out <hi>for it by the prerogative of their birth,</hi> and (as it may happen, and often doth) can no other way attain that <hi>holineſs,</hi> or that <hi>ſalvation,</hi> which is conſequent upon it? But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome men have advanc'd <hi>another,</hi> and a more <hi>improper ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> even that by which Children become the iſſue of a lawful marriage, and not of an <hi>unlawful mixture;</hi> And becauſe too they have in part advanc'd that holineſs upon the difficulty of compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending, how the unbeliever can otherwiſe be ſanctified by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, than by making the match between them two to be lawful; Therefore I will both ſet my ſelf to ſhew, that the unbeliever may be otherwiſe ſanctified by the believer, than by making him, or her to be a lawful match to the believer, and that the holineſs, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> attributes to the Children of ſuch a match, cannot be underſtood of ſuch a holineſs, whereby they become a lawful, or legitimate Iſſue. And I alledge for the former of theſe the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing Husband's, for inſtance, being ſo ſanctified by the believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wife, as not only to become a <hi>lawful</hi> Husband to her, but a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> one, and ſo, as to entitle the Iſſue of them both to the common priviledges of Chriſtianity. Which is brought about by the unbelieving Husband's becoming <hi>one fleſh,</hi> not any longer with an unbelieving Wife, but with a believing, and Chriſtian one, and from whom that ſanctification is derived to him. Even as the ſame S. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms<note n="(i)" place="margin">1 Cor. 6.16.</note> 
                        <hi>him,</hi> that <hi>converſeth with an Harlot,</hi> to become <hi>one fleſh with that Harlot,</hi> with whom he doth ſo converſe, and ſo receive pollution from her. Neither will it avail to ſay (as poſſibly it may be) that the <hi>believing Wife</hi> is as much <hi>one fleſh</hi> with the <hi>unbelieving Husband,</hi> as the <hi>unbelieving Husband</hi> is <hi>with her,</hi> and may therefore be as unclean by him, as he can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be ſanctified by her. For neither firſt is the believing Wife <hi>as much</hi> one fleſh with the unbelieving Husband, as the unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Husband is with her, unleſs it be as to the uſe of, or power over one another's Bodies: Partly, becauſe, where there is ſo great an inequality in the match, the denomination is in reaſon to be taken from the better party, which to be ſure the believer is; And partly, becauſe that conſent of mind from which this union pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, and by which it is to be upheld, is more entire, and full up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the part of the unbelieving Husband, than it is upon the part of the believing Wife. For whilſt ſhe conſents to dwell with
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56517:103"/>him meerly as the Partner of her Bed, and conformably to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of ſuch a one, of which ſhe gave a ſufficient proof by aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning him as to his Religion, and continues to do the like by the continuance of that abandoning; The unbelieving Husband, on the other ſide, by being (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſeth it)<note n="(k)" place="margin">1 Cor. 7.12, 13. <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>well pleaſed</hi> to live with her notwithſtanding, conſents in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to dwell with her as a Chriſtian, and gives no contemptible indication of a farther conſent with her in that <hi>Religion:</hi> There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwiſe no great likelihood of his continuing his <hi>Complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> as well as cohabitation to her, who had abandon'd him as to <hi>his.</hi> But therefore as the believing Wife is not ſo much <hi>one</hi> with the unbelieving Husband, as he is with her, and cannot therefore be ſo likely to be polluted by him, as he is to be ſanctified by her; So ſhe becomes yet leſs likely to be polluted by him, becauſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with him in ſuch <hi>Act,</hi> or <hi>Acts,</hi> as are not only lawful in themſelves, but moreover the indiſpenſible duties of that marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, which ſhe had contracted, and which, whilſt he is thus pleas'd to dwell with her, ſhe is by our Apoſtle himſelf obliged to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. And indeed as from ſuch a match there is more reaſon to expect ſanctification to the unbeliever, than there is of any fear of pollution to the other; So there will be yet leſs doubt of it, if we conſider the <hi>ſanctification</hi> here ſpoken of, not as an <hi>inward,</hi> but an <hi>outward</hi> one, and ſuch an outward one too, by which the party ſanctified attains only the priviledge of being accounted of as a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Husband, and accordingly of conveying to thoſe Children, that deſcend from them both a right to the Sacrament of Baptiſm. For what leſs can be expected from a merciful God, where the unbeliever, though continuing ſuch, yet takes pleaſure notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that in his Chriſtian Conſort? And ſhe, on the other ſide, though abominating his Infidelity, yet in compliance with that marriage, wherein Chriſtianity found her, cohabits with him not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, and no doubt both doth, and will employ all her kindneſs, and endeavours to gain him to a farther approbation both of her, and of the Religion ſhe hath eſpous'd? Which ſuppos'd, a way will be open to give a clearer account of the thing intended, and withal of the force it is of to perſuade the believing Wifes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing with the unbelieving Husband, if he (as is ſuppos'd in the preſent caſe) is as willing to dwell with her: The force thereof lying in this, that the believing Wife ſhould in that caſe be ſo far from being polluted by the converſe of the unbelieving Husband (which was no doubt theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> fear, when they put this caſe to S. <hi>Paul</hi>) that on the contrary the unbelieving Husband ſhould be ſo far ſanctified by her, as to be to her in the place of a Chriſtian one, and enjoy all the priviledges of ſuch; The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing Husband by becoming one fleſh with the believing Wife becoming ſo far Chriſtian alſo, and ſo accounted of both by God, and the Church. Of which they had this undeniable proof, that the Children of thoſe matches were not look'd upon as <hi>unclean,</hi> or <hi>heathen</hi> (which they muſt have been in part, if the unbeliever had not been ſome way <hi>ſanctified,</hi> as well as the believer) but accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of as ſo far <hi>holy,</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> as to be admitted to thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, to which the Children of Chriſtian Parents were, and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56517:104"/>particularly to that Baptiſm, by which a better holineſs is convey'd. This I take to be a fair, and clear account of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s words, and particularly of that <hi>holineſs,</hi> which he attributes to thoſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that deſcend from the forementioned Parents. And I am yet more confirmed in it by the fondneſs of that <hi>notion,</hi> which hath been ſet up to ſupplant it, and by which the Children of ſuch match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es become the iſſue of a <hi>lawful marriage,</hi> and not of an <hi>unlawful mixture.</hi> For beſide that they, who advance this notion, make the words <hi>Elſe were your Children unclean,</hi> &amp;c. to referr rather to the precept of the believer's cohabiting with the unbeliever, than to the unbeliever's being ſanctified by the believer, to which laſt yet it apparently referrs, and is aſſign'd by S. <hi>Paul</hi> as a proof of; They ſuppoſe that in this notion of theirs, which there is not the leaſt ground for, and which indeed this very place doth ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute. For who ever ſaid, or could ſay that the marriages of the Heathen were unlawful, which yet they muſt have been, if there needed the cohabitation of the faithful to make them lawful, and the Children that were born of them to be legitimate? Nay who ſeeth not that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſuppoſeth thoſe marriages to be lawful, when he requires the believing party to cohabit with the unbeliever? For otherwiſe no doubt he would rather have advis'd to break off all commerce with the Infidel, or proceed to a new contract. Both which yet he is ſo far from, that he ſeems to me not very willing to allow of a perfect breach, even when the unbeliever doth depart from the believer. For though he ſaith<note n="(l)" place="margin">1 Cor. 7.15.</note> that <hi>a brother, or ſiſter is not in bondage in ſuch a caſe,</hi> and may therefore, if they pleaſe, look upon themſelves as loos'd from the unbeliever; Yet he tells them<note n="(m)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> withall that <hi>God hath called us to peace,</hi> and therefore, (as I underſtand him) that breaches of that nature would be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as much as might be; And he tells them too<note n="(n)" place="margin">1 Cor. 7.16.</note>, that if they would not be over forward to make uſe of that liberty, which the unbeliever gave them by <hi>deſerting</hi> them, there might be hopes of the <hi>unbelieving Wife,</hi> or <hi>Husband</hi> being wrought upon by the <hi>believer's</hi> patience, and forbearance, and reconcil'd both to them, and their Religion. However as there is no pretence from this place of the believer's making the marriage between the unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and themſelves to be a lawful one, as which was ſo before; Nor therefore for making the <hi>holineſs</hi> of their Children to be no other than a <hi>civil</hi> one, and by which they only became a legitimate iſſue; So there is the more reaſon ſtill to underſtand the <hi>holineſs</hi> of that match, and the iſſues of it, as one that entitles them to the <hi>outward priviledges</hi> of Chriſtianity, and by which the unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving whether Husband, or Wife, comes to be accounted of as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian one, and the Children of both parties as having a right to that Sacrament, by which all are to be initiated into Chriſtianity, and partake of its Regeneration and Remiſſion.</p>
                     <p>My third and laſt argument for the baptizing of the Infants, or Children of Chriſtian Parents ſhall be taken from the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion</hi> of thoſe Infants, or Children, which deſcended from the poſterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and after which I do not ſee what doubt can be well made of the other: Partly, upon the account of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy there is between <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> and <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and partly upon
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56517:104"/>account of the Children of Chriſtian Parents having as good a right to the bleſſings exhibited in them, as the Children of thoſe, who were of the poſterity of <hi>Abraham.</hi> For ſuppoſing (as was before<note n="(o)" place="margin">Expl. of the Sacram. in general.

Now that the Children of Chriſtian Parents have as good a right to the former bleſſings, and righteouſneſs, as the Children of the Poſterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> will appear from thoſe Parents of theirs being equally the <hi>Children</hi>

                        <hi>of Abraham</hi> with thoſe, that were of his poſterity.

                     <p n="3">III. Now as if we allow Infants to be capable of Baptiſm, we muſt conſequently allow them the <hi>graces</hi> of that Sacrament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Baptiſm was intended to convey them; So I muſt needs ſay, I do not ſee why (ſuppoſing <hi>Original ſin,</hi> which hath been before ſufficiently eſtabliſh'd) we ſhould ſcruple to attribute to them the graces of that <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and particularly <hi>remiſſion,</hi> and <hi>regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> For if Infants are naturally under the <hi>guilt</hi> of Original ſin, there is ſo far forth place for, and a neceſſity of <hi>remiſſion;</hi> And if the ſame Infants are naturally under the pollution of it, or (as our <hi>Catechiſm</hi> expreſſeth it) are <hi>by nature born in ſin, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath,</hi> they are alike capable by Baptiſm of being regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, or made the <hi>children of grace.</hi> Not that there is, or can be even in baptiz'd Infants any <hi>actual perception of,</hi> or <hi>adheſion to</hi> that, which is <hi>ſpiritually good,</hi> but a <hi>diſpoſition</hi> to both, and by vertue whereof the ſoul is fitted, and inclin'd to each, when years, and opportunity invite: As the ſame ſoul is to <hi>reaſon,</hi> and <hi>will,</hi> when it arrives at years of maturity, by vertue of thoſe natural faculties, that are from the beginning in it. Which is a ſort of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56517:106"/>regeneration, that is moſt ſutable to the ſtate of Infancy, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond which therefore, whilſt they continue in that ſtate, we are not reaſonably to expect; But is withal as true a regeneration as that, which is wrought in thoſe of riper years, and by which the ſouls of the parties regenerated actually perceive, and cleave to that good, which the other is only diſpoſed to: That actual percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and <hi>adheſion</hi> being not ſo much any part of their regeneration, or new birth, as the effects, or iſſues of it.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. But becauſe how clear ſoever Infant Baptiſm may thus far ſeem, yet it cannot be deny'd to be encumbred with many, and great difficulties, or at leaſt ſuch as appear ſo to men of prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced minds; Therefore it will be but neceſſary, before I leave this head, to ſelect ſuch of them as ſeem to be moſt preſſing, and return a ſatisfactory Anſwer to them: Whether they be ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the <hi>grounds,</hi> on which I have endeavour'd to eſtabliſh it, or ſuch as ſtrike more directly at the <hi>thing</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>That, which is moſt to be conſider'd of the former ſort, is that<note n="(a)" place="margin">See <hi>Jer. Tayl.</hi> Liberty of <hi>Proph. Sect.</hi> 18. <hi>num.</hi> 13.</note> which pretends to evacuate the Argument from the <hi>Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> of the Infants of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s poſterity to the Baptizing of the Children of Chriſtians. Which it endeavours in <hi>part</hi> from <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſions</hi> being but a <hi>Type,</hi> or figure of Baptiſm, and ſo either proving nothing at all without ſome expreſs to ſignifie ſuch a thing to be its purpoſe, or after the nature of ſuch things, directing us rather to a ſpiritual childhood in order to Baptiſm, than ſhewing a natural childhood to be a due ſubject of it; And in <hi>part</hi> alſo from Circumciſions being not in all things a rule to the Chriſtians Baptiſm, and particularly not in the <hi>perſons,</hi> that are to be baptized (Women as well as Men being confeſſedly the ſubject of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) nor in the time of their receiving of it. For if Circumciſion be a ſufficient direction for the baptizing of Infants, why not alſo a like direction for the confining of it to the <hi>Males?</hi> And if it were to be a direction as to the baptizing of Infants, why not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo as to the baptizing of them upon the eighth day (which was the day of adminiſtring Circumciſion) as that <hi>Fidus,</hi> whom S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> anſwer'd, ſeemed to be perſuaded, and accordingly argued it from the like adminiſtration of Circumciſion.</p>
                     <p>As to what is objected concerning Circumciſion's being but a type of Baptiſm, and ſo either proving nothing at all without ſome expreſs to ſignifie ſuch to be its purpoſe, which is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the preſent caſe, or if proving any thing as to the matter of childhood, yet directing rather to a ſpiritual, than a natural one; I anſwer that as I ſee not why Circumciſion ſhould be look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as only a type of Baptiſm, nor indeed as any type at all, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be in a general ſenſe, and as a thing that is like unto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other may be look'd upon as a type of that, to which it is ſo, in which ſenſe I my ſelf have alſo us'd the <hi>word,</hi> and allow it ſo to be, ſo we do not at all argue from Circumciſion, as it may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be a type of Baptiſm, but as a ſign of the ſame righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Faith, of which Baptiſm is, and of the ſame gracious Covenant, that aſſures it. And in this ſenſe as nothing hinders us to argue from Circumciſion's being beſtowed upon Infants then,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56517:106"/>that that which is a ſign of the ſame righteouſneſs of faith under the Goſpel is in reaſon to be extended to the ſame perſons; So there is this in particular to enforce it, that Chriſtian Parents would otherwiſe fall ſhort, in the account of God, of the priviledges of the natural deſcendants of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Of which what account can be given, when <hi>Abraham,</hi> from whom they both claim, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be the Father of them both, yea is ſaid by S. <hi>Paul</hi> to have receiv'd the ſign of Circumciſion, not only as a <hi>ſeal,</hi> or aſſurance to himſelf <hi>of that righteouſneſs of faith,</hi> which he before had, but a ſeal, or an aſſurance alſo of his being to the ſame purpoſes a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note n="(b)" place="margin">Rom. 4.11.</note> of thoſe that believe, though they be not circumciſed, as well as a Father of thoſe that were.</p>
                     <p>There is as little reaſon to be ſtagger'd by what is alledged in the ſecond inſtance, that if Circumciſion be a ſufficient direction for the baptizing of Infants, it may as well be a direction for the confining of it to the Males, and for the confining of it too to the eighth day after the Infants birth. Becauſe firſt the Sacrament of Baptiſm hath nothing in it to confine it to the Males, as Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion had, but on the contrary is equally fitted to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to both Sexes. And ſecondly becauſe it appears from what was before ſaid<note n="(c)" place="margin">Part 1.</note> concerning the <hi>Rite</hi> of Baptiſm among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the want of Circumciſion was afterwards ſuppli'd to the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males by Baptiſm, and they thereby even in their Infancy initiated into the ſame Covenant with the other. For this ſhews yet more, how little reaſon there is to argue from Circumciſions being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to the Males, that therefore Baptiſm ought to be ſo; Or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther how much more reaſon there is to extend it both to Male, and Female, and ſo to all of the ſame Infant eſtate. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there be any thing to hinder our arguing from Circumciſion in this particular, it muſt be its not being pretended by our ſelves to be a direction as to the day of its adminiſtration, as well as to the perſons, to whom it ought to be adminiſtred. But beſide that there is a vaſt difference between the perſons, to whom any Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is to be given, and the preciſe day, on which it is to be ſo, and therefore not the like reaſon for Circumciſion's directing as to this, as there is for its directing as to the other; What Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion directs as to the caſe of Infants is more a favour, than a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, whereas what is directed as to the <hi>preciſe day</hi> is rather a command, than a favour. Now it being a rul'd caſe, That Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours are rather to be enlarg'd, than reſtrain'd, eſpecially under a Diſpenſation, which is ſo manifeſtly gracious, as that of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is, there may be reaſon enough for our interpreting what is ſaid concerning the Circumciſion of Infants to the equal, or rather greater benefit of Infants now, and conſequently that Sacrament, which came in place of it, to be rather haſtned, than deferred to a day, to which poſſibly they may not arrive, but however to be given them as ſoon, as a convenient opportunity preſents it ſelf. Add hereunto the difference there is between Circumciſion, and Baptiſm as to the trouble, or danger, which may attend the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of them to ſuch tender bodies, as thoſe of Infants are. For there being a greater trouble, and danger to Infants from the Rite
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56517:107"/>of Circumciſion, than there is from the Rite of Baptiſm; There might be greater reaſon for the deferring of that to the eighth day, than there is for the deferring of this. And what is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as to that particular, directed concerning Circumciſion, not to be drawn into example in the matter of Baptiſm, though other more material, and more advantagious circumſtances are.</p>
                     <p>But leaving what is commonly urg'd againſt the Argument from the Circumciſing of Infants, becauſe, as I ſuppoſe, ſufficiently aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoil'd by the foregoing diſcourſe. Let us take a view of ſuch Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections as ſtrike more directly at Infant Baptiſm, or at leaſt of the more material ones. Such as I take to be firſt the want of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs command, or direction for the adminiſtring of Baptiſm to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; Secondly, their being incapable of that regeneration, which is the great intent and end of Baptiſm, or giving no ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table indications of it afterwards; Thirdly, their being as inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of anſwering what is prerequired to it on the part of the perſons to be baptized, or is to be performed by them in the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of it.</p>
                     <p>That which ſeems to ſtick much with the Adverſaries of Infant Baptiſm, and is accordingly urg'd at all turns againſt the Friends, or Aſſerters of it, is the want of an expreſs command, or direction for the adminiſtring of Baptiſm to them. Which objection ſeems to be the more reaſonable, becauſe Baptiſm, as well as other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, receiving all its force from Inſtitution, they may ſeem to have no right to, or benefit by it, who appear not by the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of that Sacrament to be intitled to it, but rather, by the qualifications which it requires, to be excluded from it. And poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly more might be of the opinion of the Objecters, if there had not been before an expreſs Law for admitting Infants to that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Faith, of which Baptiſm is a ſign, and a means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, and for admitting them too by ſuch an outward ſign, as that of Baptiſm is. But ſuch an expreſs law having been before given by God, and that law as notorious as any law in either Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, there was no reaſon<note n="(d)" place="margin">See Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet's <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicum.</hi> Part 1. cap. 1. §. 3.</note> for God to give any ſuch expreſs law for the ſo adminiſtring of Baptiſm, or for us to expect it from him: It being eaſie to collect from the Analogy there is between the two Sacraments, and the great graciouſneſs of the preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, that what was communicated to the Children of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s poſterity by the ſign of Circumciſion, which was then the ſtanding way of adminiſtring it, was alike intended for the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of thoſe, who were to as good, or better purpoſe the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the ſame <hi>Abraham,</hi> and intended too to be tranſmitted to them by their particular Sacrament, and to which (as was before obſerv'd) the great graces of the Goſpel were annex'd by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour<note n="(e)" place="margin">Joh. 3.5.</note> himſelf. Which Argumentation is ſo much the more reaſonable, becauſe it appears by what was but now ſuggeſted, that our Saviour, whoſe Inſtitution Baptiſm was, gave a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent indication of his own kindneſs to that tender eſtate, yea of his owning thoſe, that were of it, to have a right to that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, to which Baptiſm by his own appointment was intended to admit men.</p>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:56517:107"/>
                     <p>The next great Objection againſt the Baptiſm of Infants is their ſuppos'd incapacity of that regeneration, which is the great end, and intent of Baptiſm, or giving no ſuitable indications of it, when they begin to be in a natural capacity to exert it. The former whereof the Anabaptiſts argue from the Scripture's ſpeaking of it<note n="(f)" place="margin">1 Pet. 1.23.</note> as produced by the <hi>word of truth,</hi> and other ſuch rational means; As the latter by the little appearance there is of it in many of thoſe, that are baptiz'd, after they arrive at the years of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Eſpecially where, as it often happens in the Dominion of the <hi>Turks,</hi> they are taken away from their Parents, before they come to be of any years, and bred up in the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For under this they are ſo far from giving any indications of a Chriſtian <hi>regeneration,</hi> that our <hi>Religion</hi> hath no greater, or more implacable enemies, than they.</p>
                     <p>As to what is argu'd toward the proof of Infants incapacity of regeneration from the Scriptures ſpeaking of it as produc'd by the word of truth, and other ſuch rational ways of procedure, I muſt needs ſay I do not ſee why it ſhould be alledg'd in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, unleſs it any where intimated, that there was no other way of producing it, no not in the Souls of Infants. For the Scripture ſpeaking <hi>to,</hi> and <hi>of men</hi> converted from Judaiſm, or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm to Chriſtianity, and conſequently brought to it in a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal way; What is ſpoken of their regeneration, is not to be drawn into example here, unleſs the ſame Scripture did any where inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate that there was no other way of regeneration than that, or it could not be otherwiſe produced. Which beſide the affront it offers to the omnipotency of God's ſpirit, and which even in <hi>men</hi> muſt be ſuppoſed to have the chiefeſt ſtroke, will need no other confutation, than Gods creating man at firſt after his own image without any concurrence of his, and producing in our Saviour, even in his conception, that perfect <hi>holineſs,</hi> which was in him. For why may not God produce in an Infant that imperfect regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereof we ſpeak, as well as he did that more perfect Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and true Holineſs, wherewith our firſt Parents were created, or that more excellent, as well as more durable one, which he did in our Saviour from the very beginning, and which the Scripture it ſelf attributes to the Holy Ghoſt's <hi>overſhadowing</hi> his Mother's Womb? But it may be, though Infants are not inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of regeneration, and ſo far forth cannot with reaſon be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barr'd the Sacrament of it; Yet there is evidence enough upon the <hi>poſtfact,</hi> that no ſuch thing is collated in their Baptiſm, and that Baptiſm of theirs therefore not to be look'd upon as a legitimate one. For if the regeneration we ſpeak of were collated in the Baptiſm of Infants, it would, (becauſe all Infants are alike qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifi'd for that Sacrament) be collated in ſome meaſure upon all of them, which yet the future behaviour of many of them doth render juſtly queſtionable: Many of them being untoward enough, when they firſt come of years, though advantaged by a ſutable edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and others (as was before ſaid) taken away early from their Chriſtian Parents, and both educated in a contrary Religion, and made zealous Proſelytes of it. Which things how they ſhould be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56517:108"/>with that regeneration, whereof we ſpeak, is at leaſt very difficult to apprehend. And poſſibly theſe two things have ſtuck more with conſidering men than moſt of the other Arguments that have been brought againſt Infant Baptiſm, and have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps given as much trouble to all thoſe, who have duly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd them. But whether they are in truth of that force, which they ſeem to be of, may well be doubted by thoſe, who ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this regeneration as the ſtate of Infants requires, or at leaſt makes it reaſonable enough to do; I mean as a weak, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect thing, and rather as the ſeed of a more ſtrong, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect regeneration, than a thoroughly form'd, and well ſetled one. For ſo if we conceive of it, we ſhall find no great difficulty to apprehend firſt, that where there is not only nothing of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian education to excite, and improve it, but a contrary one from the very beginning, and ſuch a one in particular as Chriſtian Children have from the <hi>Turks;</hi> So, I ſay, it will not be difficult to apprehend, but it may be perfectly overwhelm'd, and choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it: As that ſeed in the Parable was, that was ſown among Thorns, or as that may be ſuppos'd to be, that is covered over with rubbiſh, and hindred by it from ſprouting forth. And though I cannot ſay the ſame of the regeneration of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as have afterwards had a Chriſtian, and it may be a careful education to excite it (for here one would think it ſhould every where more forcibly exert it ſelf) yet this I may, which will be of equal force, that in that caſe it may equally fail for want of thoſe perſons exciting it, in whom that ſeed is ſown, or of their anſwering by their care, and endeavour that education, which is made uſe of in order to it. For Baptiſm (as hath been often ſaid) being in the nature of a ſtipulation, or Contract, where ſomewhat is to be perform'd by the party Baptized, as ſoon as he is in a capacity to do it, as well as by him, with whom the contract is made; No wonder if, when the baptized perſon comes to be in a capacity to perform his part, and doth not, he with whom the Contract is made, do firſt withdraw his bleſſing from that, which he hath before ſown in him, and afterward the ſeed it ſelf. For in either of theſe caſes we cannot expect ſuch indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or effects of the Baptiſmal regeneration, as otherwiſe we might, and as do actually ſhew themſelves in many of thoſe, who have been made partakers of it. It may be enough that God hath furniſh'd ſuch perſons with a regeneration, which during their minority will qualifie them for, and ſecure them to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and a regeneration too which, if well improv'd, will grow into a more complete, and effectual one, and in fine bring them to a due holineſs, and unto God. If the baptized perſons will, when they are in a capacity to do better, neglect to excite it, or will oppoſe it, they muſt thank themſelves, if they miſcarry, and not lay the blame upon any failure on Chriſt's part, and much leſs deny his having conferred it on them.</p>
                     <p>The third, and laſt great Objection againſt the Baptiſm of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants is their being incapable of anſwering what is prerequired to it on the part of the perſons that are to be baptized, or is to be
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56517:108"/>performed by them in the receiving of it. Which incapacity they argue, as to the former of theſe, from the Scripture's pre-requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Faith, and Repentance to it, as the latter from that ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, which Baptiſm involves, and which Infants are equally incapacitated to make.</p>
                     <p>The Anſwer, which our Catechiſm makes to theſe difficulties, or at leaſt to the former, is, that <hi>they promiſe them both by their ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which promiſe, when they come to Age, themſelves are bound to perform.</hi> And poſſibly this Anſwer might be better digeſted than it is, if the minds of thoſe, who argue againſt Infant-Baptiſm, were more free, and unprejudic'd, than they commonly appear to be. Becauſe firſt what is urg'd againſt Infant-Baptiſm upon the account of its being a ſtipulation, or Contract is equally of force againſt the Circumciſion of Infants, becauſe that was equally a Covenant, or rather a ſign of it, and a means of entring into it. Which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, the Infants of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s poſterity were by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God himſelf admitted to it, and thereupon reckon'd as in Covenant with him. Now if the Infants of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity were by the Command of God admitted into Covenant with him; What ſhould hinder the Infants of Chriſtians from Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting in like manner with him, and ſo far forth from being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the participation of that Sacrament, which is a ſign of the ſame gracious Covenant, and a means of entring into it? Again Secondly, though Infants cannot in ſtrictneſs Covenant with God, becauſe neither having <hi>reaſon</hi> enough to apprehend the terms of it, nor <hi>will</hi> to determine themſelves to the performance of them; Yet as they may <hi>by favour</hi> be admitted to a partnerſhip in a Covenant, and where God, or Chriſt is the perſon, with whom they contract, obliged when they come of years to anſwer their part in it, ſo by the ſame favour of him, with whom they contract, what is done to them, or for them, may be interpreted as a promiſe on their part for the performance of it. By which means though they ſhould not be capable of a ſtrict, and proper ſtipulation, yet they may of that, which is interpretatively ſuch. The only farther doubt in this affair is, whether God accepts of ſuch a ſtipulation, which his accepting of it under the Covenant of Circumciſion, and from the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural poſterity will eaſily remove. For the Covenant of Baptiſm being no way inferior in it ſelf to (or rather but the ſame Covenant in a different dreſs with) the Covenant of Circumciſion, nor the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſpiritual ſeed inferior to thoſe of the natural one; What was accepted of under the Covenant of Circumciſion, and from the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural ſeed may as reaſonably be preſum'd to be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of under Baptiſm, and from the Children of his ſpiritual. How much more, when (as was before ſhewn) his Son, and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt<note n="(g)" place="margin">Mark 10.14.</note> hath commanded Children to be brought to him for his benediction, and grace, and his Apoſtle and our great Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter S. <hi>Paul</hi> declar'd the Children of Chriſtians to be <hi>holy,</hi> yea where but one of the Parents is ſo? Thus we may rationally an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer what is objected againſt the ſtipulation of Infants, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently againſt their taking upon them what is requir'd of them
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56517:109"/>in the receiving of Baptiſm; Which will leave nothing to us to make anſwer to, but their ſuppoſed incapacity for that faith, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which ſeem to be pre-required to it, and which one would think they, that are to be baptiz'd, ſhould bring with them in ſome meaſure, as well as make a promiſe of. But beſide that thoſe Texts<note n="(h)" place="margin">Mark 16.15, 16. Acts 2.38. Acts 8.37.</note>, which ſpeak of theſe prerequiſites, do all mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly relate to adult perſons, and ſuch as are brought to Baptiſm by the preaching of the Goſpel, and therefore not lightly to be urg'd in the caſe of Infants; There are theſe three ſubſtantial rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to make a difference between Infants, and Men as to this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. Firſt, that Infants are not admitted to Baptiſm, and the graces of it upon the account of any right in themſelves, but of the right of their Parents. Secondly, that they are admitted for the preſent to a leſſer portion of the Divine graces, than adult per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are, and ſuch as are rather the ſeeds of them, than any through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly form'd, or well ſetled ones. Thirdly, that what right they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by their Baptiſm to future, and more perfect priviledges, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends for their actually attaining them upon their exhibiting that faith, and repentance, which at the time of their Baptiſm they only made a promiſe of. For if (as is alledged in the firſt reaſon) Infants are not admitted to Baptiſm and the Graces of it, upon the account of any right in themſelves, but of the right of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; What ſhould hinder <hi>the Church from lending</hi>

In fine, if (as is alledged in the third reaſon) what right Infants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by their Baptiſm to future, and more perfect priviledges, depends for their attaining of them, upon their exhibiting that Faith, and Repentance, which at the time of their Baptiſm they only made a promiſe of; It may be time enough, when that right is to be actuated, to exhibit that Faith, and Repentance, and ſo make way for it, as they, who are of years, do. Otherwiſe more ſhall be ſuppos'd to be requir'd of Infants, than is of adult per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons themſelves; Becauſe that Faith and Repentance is not requir'd of the latter, till the full priviledges of Baptiſm are to be beſtow'd upon them. And I ſhall only add, that if care were taken that the Faith, and Repentance of thoſe, who were baptiz'd in their Infancy, were as well enquir'd into, and prov'd as their knowledge in the <hi>Catechiſm</hi> is, before they were allow'd to be confirm'd; The Church would not only better diſcharge the truſt, that is repoſed in her as concerning thoſe perſons, whoſe Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56517:109"/>were not before prov'd, nor could be, but more effectually ſtop the mouths of the Anabaptiſts, than all the Arguments ſhe, or her Sons offer for Infant Baptiſm, will ever be able to do. For ſo ſhe would make it appear, that though ſhe contented her ſelf in their Baptiſm with the promiſe that was made for them, or rather with that tacit ſtipulation, which their very Baptiſm involves; Yet ſhe was as mindful, when they came of years, to oblige them to the performance of it, and to give due proofs in their own perſons of all thoſe things, which Baptiſm in adult perſons doth either pre-ſuppoſe, or oblige to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of.</p>

For what do they differ in effect from Heathen, or Inſidels, who either never before had, or have fallen quite off from the regeneration, or faith of Baptiſm? And if they differ not at all from them, why ſhould they not, if they repent, and return, be received as Heathen, or Infidels, I mean by the Sacrament of Baptiſm? Eſpecially, when in the ordinary diſpenſation of God the graces of the Sacrament are annexed to the Sacrament, nor can be expected without it. For, that ſuppos'd, why ſhould not theſe men, being to begin their Chriſtianity a-new, come a ſecond time under that Sacrament, which is to enter beginners into it, and give them the regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and remiſſion of it?</p>
                     <p>Of what force theſe Objections are, ſhall be afterward conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; The only reaſon of my preſent mention of them is to ſhew, that the queſtion is not without its difficulty, and that if we will ſatisfie our underſtandings ſo, as to be able to ſatisfie others, we muſt enquire into the grounds of the Churches opinion, as well as be ſatisfied, that the Church hath been ſo perſuaded. Which we ſhall find the more reaſon for, becauſe one principal Text, which hath been alledged, ſeems not to come up to it, nor indeed to have any relation to that affair; That I mean, which ſuggeſts <hi>one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi>
                        <note n="†" place="margin">Eph. 4.5.</note> as well as <hi>one Lord,</hi> and <hi>one Faith</hi> in him. For the deſign of the Apoſtle in that place being to perſwade the <hi>Epheſians</hi> to uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and peace among themſelves, as that too, among other things by there being <hi>one Lord, one Faith,</hi> and <hi>one Baptiſm,</hi> cannot ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be thought to mean any other, than that they all had one <hi>common Lord,</hi> to whom they related, one <hi>common</hi> Faith in that Lord, and one <hi>common</hi> Baptiſm, or mode of initiating into it: That unity, as it beſt agrees with that <hi>one hope of their calling,</hi> by which they are alſo preſt, becauſe declared to be <hi>one</hi>
                        <note n="†" place="margin">Eph 4.4.</note>, <hi>in which they were all called;</hi> So moſt naturally, and moſt immediately enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing that agreement with one another, for the inculcating where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are all ſuggeſted. I ſay not the ſame, nor can of that unity of Baptiſm, which imports only a ſingle adminiſtration of it to one, and the ſame perſon; That unity, though it may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the perſon to ſtick cloſe to his Religion, and to the profeſſion he hath made of it in that <hi>one</hi> Baptiſm of his, yet perſwading not any adheſion to, or unity with other Baptized perſons, than as they may be ſuppos'd to partake <hi>in common</hi> with him in it. But it may be there is more force in what is alledged from our Saviour, where he ſaith<note n="(a)" place="margin">Joh. 13.10.</note>, that <hi>he, that is waſhed,</hi> even by a more general waſhing, <hi>needeth not ſave to waſh his feet.</hi> And ſo no doubt there is, if by the former <hi>waſhing be</hi> meant the <hi>waſhing</hi> of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> as ſome of the Antients conceiv'd, and as I have elſewhere<note n="(b)" place="margin">Part 2.</note> made it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56517:111"/>But there is this exception againſt it, as to the thing we are now about, that it ſeems to ſuppoſe the more general purity procured by it to abide, and mens affections, or actions only to have ſome pollution in them. Whereas thoſe, concerning whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptization we intreat, either never had, or have forfeited their baptiſmal regeneration, or fallen off altogether from that Religion to which it belongs.</p>
                     <p>Now that, which in my opinion ought to have the firſt place in our thoughts is the no direction there is in Scripture for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of Baptiſm, where the like Apoſtaſie, or impiety hath happened, but rather a direction to a contrary courſe. And I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance for the proof thereof in <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> after he had deny'd, and forſworn his Maſter; And in <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> after he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to ſo great a degree of impiety, as to offer the Apoſtles mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for the gift of the Holy Ghoſt. For to the former of theſe, even S. <hi>Peter,</hi> we find no other waſhing directed, ſave that<note n="(c)" place="margin">Luk. 22.61.</note> of <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitential tears;</hi> Nay we find him admoniſhed<note n="(d)" place="margin">Luk. 22.22.</note>, as well as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed after that <hi>converſion</hi> of his to ſet himſelf to the <hi>ſtrengthning of his brethren.</hi> Which in all probability he would not have been without a foregoing Baptiſm, if our Saviour had meant for the future, that nothing but a new Baptiſm ſhould be able to convert ſuch Apoſtates to himſelf: His paſſing over ſo great an Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in a prime diſciple of his upon his bare repentance being apt to encourage other men to preſume of the ſame unto themſelves. Neither will it avail to ſay, that this inſtance will not reach the caſe, becauſe it doth not appear, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was baptiz'd before. For ſuppoſing that he were not, which yet (as was heretofore<note n="(e)" place="margin">Part 2.</note> obſerv'd) in all probability he was, the caſe of the Rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizers will not be render'd better, but rather ſo much the worſe for it. For if he was not baptiz'd before, there was the more reaſon he ſhould be baptized now, if nothing but a new Baptiſm generally can waſh away Apoſtaſie. The inſtance of <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> is yet more clear, and unexceptionable, where the regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Baptiſm hath not been before receiv'd, or forfeited after the receiving of it. For that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> either never receiv'd, or had now loſt the Baptiſmal regeneration, is evident from the words of S. <hi>Peter</hi> to him; That holy man not only curſing him<note n="(f)" place="margin">Acts 8.20.</note> 
                        <hi>for his offer of money,</hi> but telling him in expreſs terms, that <hi>he had neither lot, nor part in</hi> the <hi>matter</hi>
                        <note n="(g)" place="margin">Acts 8.21.</note> of Chriſtianity, and <hi>that his heart was not right in the ſight of God,</hi> in fine that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, that <hi>he was in the gall of bitterneſs</hi>
                        <note n="(h)" place="margin">Acts 8.23.</note>, <hi>and in the bond of iniquity.</hi> Which notwithſtanding, the ſame S. <hi>Peter</hi> directed him only<note n="(i)" place="margin">Acts 8.22.</note> to <hi>repent of that his wickedneſs, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of his heart might be forgiven him.</hi> Which how could S. <hi>Peter</hi> have done, eſpecially in ſo notorious a caſe, if a ſecond Baptiſm had been neceſſary to waſh away that ſinful eſtate, which the former Baptiſm had not purg'd, or at leaſt which had retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned after it.</p>
                     <p>My ſecond Argument againſt the repetition of Baptiſm is the no neceſſity of it in either of the foremention'd inſtances. As will appear whether we conſider it as a means of obliging us to that piety, which our Religion requires, or as a means of conveying the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56517:112"/>graces of it. For in the former notion it is as really, and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally an obligation to a Chriſtian life in an unſincere perſon, or one who afterwards apoſtatizeth, as if it had been never ſo hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily intended; The obligation thereof ariſing not from the ſecret ſentiments of the perſon, that is baptized, or his conſtancy to his profeſſion, but from the nature of the thing it ſelf, and the Inſtitution of God, that preſcrib'd it. Provided therefore we take upon us the Sacrament it ſelf, we tie our ſelves by it without remedy, neither can there therefore be any need of our obliging our ſelves by it a ſecond time, unleſs he, who inſtituted it, ſhould require it of us. It is true indeed ſo far as we have departed from it whether by Apoſtaſie, or impiety, ſo far it will concern us to own it again to our Lord, and Maſter, by our repentance of the breaches of it, and a repetition of the ſame vows unto him; And it will concern us too, if the Church requires it, to ſatisfie that alſo, that we do ſo repent, and will amend. But as both the one, and the other may be done without the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of our Baptiſm, ſo a frank acknowledgment with our mouths, together with the receit of the Lord's Supper, may very well ſerve for thoſe purpoſes, becauſe ſerving a like to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare them. But it may be, the principal difficulty in this affair lies in what concerns Baptiſm as a means of conveying the graces of it, and particularly our regeneration, and new birth. And I muſt confeſs I was for ſome time at a loſs what to think in it, till I conſider'd that the Sacrament of Baptiſm was not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a phyſical cauſe, or conveyer of Grace, that we ſhould think the grace of it could not be in the receiver of Baptiſm, unleſs it were either preſently produced in him, or conveyed to him, but a moral inſtrument thereof, or a means to which God hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed the promiſe of it. For ſuch a one by the favour of that God, who hath annexed the promiſe of his Grace unto it, may operate at a diſtance, as well as in preſence, and accordingly may convey it to the receiver of Baptiſm, as well after his Baptiſm, as together with it, yea convey it after the baptized perſon hath loſt it, as well as it did at firſt. Which ſuppos'd, the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining difficulty will be, whether we may reaſonably expect it from God, ſuppoſing the baptized perſon to return, and repent. A thing, which they have little reaſon to queſtion, who believe God to allow a ſecond Baptiſm upon it, and we ſhall have far leſs, if we reflect upon the former inſtances of <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus.</hi> For if God will allow of the remedy of a ſecond Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm upon repentance, why not alſo allow the firſt Baptiſm to be the means of conveying his graces, and our health, and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Eſpecially, when the breaches of it come to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and the vow thereof renewed. And if God accepted of S. <hi>Peter</hi> upon his bare repentance, and directed <hi>Simon Magus</hi> to no other remedy, than that, and prayer; We may as well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that if he accept us at all, he will accept us upon that, and our old Baptiſm, and ſo make that co-operate to the reſpective graces of it.</p>
                     <p>Theſe I take to be ſufficient Arguments againſt the repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Baptiſm, and the more, becauſe they alſo ſuggeſt as ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56517:112"/>anſwers to what hath been before alledged for it. For neither can they be look'd upon as Heathen, and conſequently as ſtanding in need of a new Baptiſm, who however they may have renounc'd the old, whether by their Impiety, or Apoſtaſie, yet ever were, and ever will be under the obligation of it. And much leſs after their repentance, and return can they be thought to want it toward the producing of that regeneration, which they are without: Their former Baptiſm, through the favour of him who annex'd the promiſe of regeneration to that Sacrament, being as effectual for that purpoſe, as any new Baptiſm whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Baptiſm is indeed generally neceſſary to regeneration, it is ſo neceſſary that no man living can promiſe it to himſelf without it; But if it be of as much value, as neceſſity, it may, and no doubt will induce him, who is the diſpenſer of his own graces, to confer it upon a former, as well as upon any new adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am now at an end of a long, and laborious Work, begun and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on in the more proſperous times of our Church, but finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with no leſs Zeal for that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which ſhe profeſſeth, and with an equal, if not greater regard to Your Lordſhip, who to your own immortal Honour, and the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of all good Men, have ſo firmly adhered to it.</p>
                  <p>The Argument, that is now before me, hath (I doubt not) been handled by much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Pens, and, if I may judge by thoſe few Treatiſes which I have ſeen, in a way worthy of the Age we live in, and of that Religion, which we have the honour to profeſs. But whether any one Man hath ſpoken to the ſeveral parts thereof, which is my proper Buſineſs, is
<pb facs="tcp:56517:115"/>more than I my ſelf have obſerved, or receiv'd any intimation of from other Men. However, I have been ſo fearful of tranſcribing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of others, that I have avoided to look into many things, which I my ſelf might have profited by; As conceiving that a Man's own natural thoughts, how ſlight ſoever, may be more uſeful, and acceptable, than a repetition of far better ones of other Men. If, whilſt I too eagerly purſue my own thoughts, I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time happen to ſtumble, they, who conſider the honeſty of my Deſign, will, I hope, be more ready to pity, and pardon, than any way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult over my Infirmities. Which hopes I am the more confirmed in, becauſe I have all along had the Scripture in my Eye, and particularly thoſe parts thereof, which give an account of the Inſtitution of this Sacrament, and by which, if by any thing, we muſt attain a due under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of it.</p>
                  <p>If what I have offer'd upon this, and the other parts of our Churches Catechiſm, may be ſo uſeful to its Members, as to furniſh them with a <hi>General Idea</hi> of the <hi>Doctrines</hi> it contains, and ſufficient <hi>Arguments</hi> to confirm them, I ſhall think my Pains to have been as profitably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd, as a Man of my Circumſtances was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of employing them: That, which in my poor Opinion hath been the great Bane of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> being the neceſſity the Members thereof have been under of laying the foundation of their Knowledge in <hi>foreign Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemes,</hi> which have not only much alienated their
<pb facs="tcp:56517:115"/>Affections from the Religion profeſs'd among us, but ſo prejudic'd their Minds againſt it, as to make them proof againſt the greateſt Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which the beſt of our Writers have been able to offer to them. Which therefore if theſe my Labours may ſerve in any meaſure to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, I have as much as I deſire; But however, ſhall reſt ſatisfi'd in this, that I have done the beſt ſervice I could to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and have therefore little left me to do, ſave to pray for the Proſperity thereof, which is, and ſhall be the daily employment of</p>

                     <p>THE Story of the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> firſt ſet down out of the <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,</hi> and <hi>St. Paul,</hi> and animadverted upon in the ſeveral parts of it. Where, after an account of the time of it, the conſequents where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are alſo declar'd, entrance is made with the conſideration of the <hi>Bread,</hi> and both the <hi>quality</hi> of that Bread, and Chriſt's <hi>taking</hi> it, explain'd. This followed by a more ample declaration of Chriſt's <hi>bleſſing</hi> it, and that <hi>Bleſſing</hi> both ſhewn to have the Bread for its object, and to conſiſt in making it uſeful for the purpoſes of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or rather in Chriſt's addreſſing himſelf to his Father to make it ſuch. That addreſs of his thereupon carefully enquir'd into, and (becauſe it appears from St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> to have been by Thankſgiving) enquiry alſo made what benefits he ſo gave thanks for, what uſe that Thanksgiving was of toward the procuring of the bleſſing deſir'd, and whether it did not alſo contain ſome expreſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
<pb facs="tcp:56517:117"/>to God for the granting of it. Of Chriſt's <hi>breaking</hi> the Bread, its ſignification, and momentouſneſs, as alſo of his <hi>giving</hi> it to his Diſciples, and requiring them to <hi>take,</hi> and <hi>eat</hi> of it. The words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> next taken into conſideration, and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, and minutely explain'd. Where is ſhewn at large that by the word <hi>This</hi> muſt be meant <hi>This Bread,</hi> and that there is nothing in the gender of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> to hinder it; That by <hi>body</hi> muſt be meant that <hi>body,</hi> which Chriſt now carried about him, and was ſhortly after to ſuffer in, and that the ſigurativeneſs of the propoſition lies in the word <hi>is.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon occaſion whereof is alſo ſhewn; that that word is oftentime figuratively taken; that it ought to be ſo taken here, and that accordingly it imports the Bread to be a ſign, and a memorial, and a means of partaking of Chriſt's body. This part of the Inſtitution concluded with an explication of the words, <hi>which is given,</hi> or <hi>broken</hi> for you, and a more ample one of Chriſt's commanding his Diſciples to <hi>do this in remembrance of him.</hi> Where the precept, <hi>Do this,</hi> is ſhewn to refer to what Chriſt had before done, or enjoyned them to do; And they enjoyn'd ſo to <hi>do,</hi> to renew in themſelves a grateful remembrance of Chriſt's death, or prompt other Men to the like remembrance of it. That part of the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which reſpects the <hi>Cup,</hi> more ſuccinctly handled, and enquiry made, among other things, into the declaration, which our Saviour makes concerning its being his <hi>Blood of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the New Teſtament</hi> in it. Where is ſhewn, What <hi>that</hi> is, which our Saviour affirms to be ſo, what is meant by his <hi>Blood of the New Teſtament,</hi> or <hi>The New Teſtament in it,</hi> and <hi>how</hi> the Cup, or rather the Wine of it <hi>was</hi> that Blood of his, or the New Teſtament in it. <hi>pag. 173.</hi>

The <hi>former</hi> of theſe brought under Conſideration, and ſhewn to be the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Chriſt, not as they were at, or before the Inſtitution of this Sacrament, or as they now are, but as they were at the time of his Crucifixion, as moreover then offered up unto God, and offer'd up to him alſo as a propitiatory Sacrifice for the Sins of the World. The Conſequences of that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion briefly noted, both as to the preſence of that Body, and Blood in the Sacrament, and our perception of them.

                     <p>THE outward Part, or Sign of this Sacrament conſider'd with a more particular regard to the Body, and Blood of Chriſt, and Enquiry accordingly made, what farther relation it beareth to it. That it is a <hi>Means,</hi> whereby we receive the ſame, as well as a <hi>Sign</hi> thereof, ſhewn from the Doctrine of our Church, and that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine confirm'd by Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s entitling it the <hi>Communion</hi> of Chriſt's Body, and Blood, and by his affirming Men to be <hi>made to drink into one Spirit</hi> by partaking of the Cup of it. Enquiry next made, <hi>what kind of Means</hi> this Sign of the Lord's Supper is, <hi>how it conveys to us</hi> the Body, and Blood of Chriſt, and <hi>how we receive</hi> them by it. To each of which Anſwer is made from the Doctrine of our Church, and that Anſwer farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by the Doctrine of the Scripture. The ſum of which is, that this Sign of the Lord's Supper is, ſo far forth, a Mean ſpiritual, and heavenly; That it conveys the Body, and Blood of Chriſt to
<pb facs="tcp:56517:118"/>us, by prompting us to reflect, as the Inſtitution requires, upon that Body, and Blood of his, and by prompting God, who hath annex'd them to the due uſe of the Sign, to beſtow that Body, and Blood upon us; In fine, that we receive them by the Sign thereof, when we take occaſion from thence to reflect upon that Body, and Blood of Chriſt, which it was intended to repreſent, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly with Faith in them. What Benefits we receive by Chriſt's Body, and Blood, in the next place enquir'd, and as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd by our <hi>Catechiſm</hi> to be the <hi>ſtrengthening, and refreſhing</hi> of the Soul, ſo Enquiry thereupon made what is meant by the ſtrengthening, and refreſhing of the Soul, what Evidence there is of Chriſt's Body and Blood being intended for it, and how they effect it. The Sign of the Lord's Supper a Pledge to aſſure us of Chriſt's Body, and Blood, as well as a Means, whereby we receive them. <hi>pag. 219.</hi>

Whereof the <hi>firſt</hi> is, that the whole ſubſtance of the Bread is chang'd into the ſubſtance of Chriſt's Body, and the whole ſubſtance of the Wine into the ſubſtance of his Blood. The grounds of this Aſſertion examin'd both as to the poſſibility, and actual being of ſuch a change. What is alledg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d for the <hi>former</hi> of theſe from the ſubſtantial changes mention'd in the Scripture of no force in this particular, becauſe there is no appearance of the actual exiſting of thoſe things, into which the change was made at the inſtant the other were chang'd into them. As little force ſhewn to be in the words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and, <hi>This is my Blood,</hi> to prove the actual change of the Sacramental Elements, whether we conſider the word <hi>This</hi> in the former words as denoting the Bread, and Wine, or <hi>The thing I now give you.</hi> That ſuppoſed change farther impugned by ſuch Scriptures, as repreſent the Bread of the Euchariſt as remaining after Conſecration, by the concurrent Teſtimony of Senſe, and the Doctrine of the Antient Fathers. Enquiry next made into that Aſſertion, which imports, that the ſubſtances of the Sacramental Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſo chang'd, as to retain nothing of what they were before, ſave only the Species thereof. Where is ſhewn, that if nothing of their reſpective Subſtances remain, there muſt be an annihilation, rather than a change, and that there is as little ground for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining of the Species without them, either from the nature of thoſe Species, the words of Conſecration, or the Teſtimony of Senſe. That the true Body, and true Blood of Chriſt, together with his Soul, and Divinity, are under the Species of the Sacramental Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, a <hi>third</hi> Capital Aſſertion in this Matter, but hath as little ground in the words of Conſecration, as either of the former. Firſt,
<pb facs="tcp:56517:119"/>becauſe thoſe words relate not to Chriſt's glorified Body, and Blood, which are the things affirmed to be contain'd under the Species of the Sacramental Elements, but to Chriſt's Body, as broken, and to his Blood as ſhed at his Crucifixion. Secondly, becauſe however they may import the being of that Body, and Blood in the Euchariſt, yet they ſpecifie nothing as to the <hi>modus</hi> of it, and much leſs inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate any thing concerning their being under the Species thereof. That that Body, and Blood (which is the <hi>fourth</hi> Capital Aſſertion in this Matter) are truly, really, and ſubſtantially under the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Species, ſhewn to be as groundleſs; and Evidence made of the contrary by ſuch Arguments from Senſe, and Reaſon, as are moreover confirmed to us by the Authority of Revelation. Some brief Reflections in the cloſe upon the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of Chriſt in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and more large ones upon what the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> advance concerning the <hi>real eating</hi> of him in it. Where is ſhewn that that, which they call a real eating, is a very improper one, that it is however of no neceſſity, or uſe toward our ſpiritual nouriſhment by him, and not only no way confirm'd by the diſcourſe of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in the ſixth of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, but abundantly confuted by it. <hi>pag. 227.</hi>

                     <p>AN account of that Doctrine, which is by us called Conſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, out of the Auguſtan Confeſſion, and <hi>Gerhard;</hi> And as it is founded by him, and other the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Doctors in the letter of the words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and, <hi>This is my Blood,</hi> ſo Enquiry there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon made <hi>firſt,</hi> whether thoſe words ought to be taken in the literal ſenſe; Secondly, whether, if ſo taken, Conſubſtantiation can be inferred from them. That the former words ought to be taken in the literal ſenſe is endeavour'd by the <hi>Lutherans</hi> to be prov'd by <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi> and <hi>ſpecial</hi> Arguments, and thoſe Arguments therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, and anſwer'd. What is alledg'd in the <hi>general</hi> concerning the literal ſenſe of Scripture being for the moſt part to be preferr'd before the figurative, willingly allow'd; But that no exception ought to be made, unleſs where the Scripture it ſelf obligeth us to depart from the literal ſenſe, ſhewn to be neither true in it ſelf, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to the preſent Texts, becauſe there is enough in the words, that follow them, to oblige us to preferr the figurative ſenſe before it. The <hi>Lutherans ſpecial</hi> Arguments next brought under Conſideration, and Firſt that, which is drawn from the ſuppoſed <hi>newneſs,</hi> and <hi>ſtrangeneſs</hi> of the Chriſtian Sacraments at the firſt, and which conſequently requir'd, that they ſhould be deliver'd in proper, and literal Expreſſions, as without which otherwiſe there could have been no certain knowledge of them. Where is ſhewn, that the Chriſtian Sacraments were neither ſuch new, and ſtrange things at the firſt

The want of an undoubted remedy from thence the occaſion of providing a new, and, becauſe the former was apparent to our Senſes, of a like outward, and viſible one.

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56517:122"/>the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of it: Each of theſe being of uſe toward the diſcovery of the nature of that, which I am now upon the inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of.</p>
                     <p>That which ſeems to me to have been the general <hi>ground</hi> of our Saviour's inſtituting another Sacrament after Baptiſm, is that firſt Sacrament's leaving place for the entring in of new, and groſs Errors, and conſequently a kind of neceſſity, <hi>on the part of Chriſt,</hi> of new ſenſible means, and aſſurances of that Grace, which is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them, and a like neceſſity, <hi>on our part,</hi> of ſuch new declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our renouncing our former Errors, and giving up our ſelves to his Service. For though Baptiſm (as was before<note n="*" place="margin">Expl. of Bapt. Part 6.</note> obſerv'd) profeſs to mortifie our Corruptions, and regenerate our Natures; Though it do it in ſuch a meaſure as to make us Conquerours over the former, and change the latter for the main into pious, and holy: Yet as it leaves place<note n="†" place="margin">Expl. of the Lord's Prayer, in the words, <hi>Forgive us,</hi> &amp;c.</note> in the beſt of Men for new Errours to enter in, and which accordingly they are enjoyn'd to ask daily the forgiveneſs of; ſo it is equally apparent from the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the World, and from the care the Scripture<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 2.6. Gal. 6.2.</note> takes for the reſtoring of lapſed men, that Baptiſm doth not ſo reform mens Natures, but that through the prevalency of temptations, or their own careleſneſs they may fall into great and ſcandalous Errours, and ſuch as cannot therefore be ſuppos'd to be conſiſtent with that Holineſs, which in Baptiſm they made profeſſion of. Now as in ſuch a caſe it is eaſie to ſee, that men would have been apt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond, if they had had nothing but their Baptiſm to truſt to, becauſe having by the breach of their Baptiſmal Vow forfeited their title to the Graces of it: So it ſeem'd therefore little leſs than neceſſary to have ſome new Remedy aſſign'd them, and ſuch as ſhould be as apparent to their ſenſe, as their former was, as which otherwiſe could not have been ſo ſatisfactory to them. For by the ſame reaſon that it came to be thought needful to make uſe of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible means to convey, or aſſure to mankind God's Pardon, and Grace upon their firſt converſion to Chriſtianity; By the ſame, or a greater Reaſon it muſt be judg'd to be ſo to make uſe of the like ſenſible means to convey, or aſſure the ſame Grace, and Pardon, after men have in any meaſure forfeited the intereſt they have in the other. By the ſame reaſon again that it came to be thought needful to exact of us ſenſible declarations of our renouncing the Errours of our unconverted eſtate, and giving up our ſelves to Chriſt's ſervice; By the ſame, or a greater Reaſon muſt it be judg'd to be ſo to exact of us the like ſenſible declarations, after we have by our diſobedience departed from, and prevaricated the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ones. It is true indeed Chriſt might, if he had ſo pleas'd (For no man dreams of any abſolute neceſſity of either) have convey'd, and aſſur'd to us the divine Pardon, and Grace by the ſole Miniſtry of his Word; And he might too have receiv'd us to both upon the like verbal declarations from our ſelves: But as he might as well have done both upon our firſt converſion to Chriſtianity, and yet choſe rather to do it by the mediation of Baptiſm; So if there were any reaſon for the former (as to be ſure Chriſt doth not act without one) there is equal reaſon for the latter, and an equal neceſſity conſequently of his inſtituting another Sacrament after
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56517:122"/>Baptiſm to ſupply thoſe defects, which Baptiſm could not ſo well provide for. Sure I am, whilſt the Precepts of Chriſtianity were yet freſh in the minds of men, and they therefore as ſenſible of the leaſt violations of them; ſuch was their opinion of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of another Sacrament after Baptiſm, that they paſs'd imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from that<note n="(a)" place="margin">Juſtin Martyr, <hi>Apol. 2.</hi>
                        </note> to the celebration of the Lord's Supper, and (which is more) were ſo intent upon it, that no day paſs'd them without the receit of it, but however no day, wherein there was an opportunity of aſſembling themſelves for the publick Worſhip of God, and celebrating the other parts of it.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe the former defects might have been provided for by other Sacraments, and thoſe defects therefore no proper ground of Chriſt's choice of this particular one; Therefore it will be requiſite for us to find out ſome other ground of it, and which, all things conſider'd, cannot better be fix'd, than in an uſage of the Jews, and which being ſo, might with their better liking be converted by him into a Sacrament, and more readily receiv'd and embrac'd.</p>

Preſently after he took a <hi>Loaf of Bread,</hi> and holding it with both his hands conſecrated it in theſe words, <hi>Bleſſed be thou O Lord our God, who bringeſt Food out of the Earth.</hi> Which ſaid, he brake it, and after he had eaten a piece of it himſelf, gave the like to each that ſate with him. Thus that Learned Man informs us, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Family did at their ſitting down at their more ſolemn Feaſts; As after the Feaſt was over, that he, or ſome other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to whom he committed it, taking a ſecond time a Cup full of Wine into both his hands, prayed, <hi>Let us bleſs him, who hath fed us of his own, and by whoſe goodneſs we live:</hi> Paſſing on from thence to other Bleſſings, and Prayers, and particularly to bleſs God for the Food, which he had afforded to them all, and for all the Benefits beſtow'd either on their Fathers, or themſelves, and to pray unto him in like manner for the ſtate of their Nation, for the reſtoring of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for the coming of <hi>Elias,</hi> and the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and particularly for their Domeſticks, and Kindred. After which the ſame perſon began as before, <hi>Bleſſed be thou, O Lord our God, King of the World, who createſt the Fruit of the Vine,</hi> and thereupon again drank a little of the Wine himſelf, and then gave it in order to his Gueſts.</p>
                     <p>Now as it is eaſie to gueſs by the likeneſs there is between our Sacrament, and this Uſance, that our Sacrament, or rather the Author thereof took his Pattern from thence, if that Uſance be ancienter than the Sacrament it ſelf; So there is juſt ground to believe it was, both from what we find in St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s account of Chriſt's celebration of the Paſſover, and this Sacrament, and from the manner wherewith this Sacrament was celebrated in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity. For St. <hi>Luke</hi> in his account of the former

It ſhall ſuffice me to eſtabliſh that title of the <hi>Lord</hi>'s Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per from the Authority of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> where he tells his <hi>Corinthians</hi>
                        <note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.20.</note> that <hi>what they did,</hi> when they came together, <hi>was not to eat the Lord</hi>'s <hi>Supper.</hi> For though that, which he reproves in them, even<note n="(b)" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.21.</note> every one's taking before other his own Supper, pertained not to the nature, or ſubſtance of the Sacrament, and ſo may ſeem to refer the title of the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Supper,</hi> rather to thoſe <hi>Agapae,</hi> or Love-feaſts, that then accompany'd it, than to the Sacrament it ſelf; Yet will it not from thence follow, but that we may, and ought to underſtand St. <hi>Paul</hi> there of the Sacrament of the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and the <hi>Corinthians</hi> violating it by that means.</p>
                     <p>That we may underſtand St. <hi>Paul</hi> there of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the Lord's Supper, and the <hi>Corinthians</hi> violating it by taking before other their own Supper, is probable firſt from what St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms, both here<note n="(c)" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.10.</note> and elſewhere<note n="(d)" place="margin">1 Cor. 3.4.</note> concerning their diviſions, and from the proof they gave of it in their taking before other their own Supper. For being divided into ſeveral factions, and ſuch as were each of them under their peculiar head, it is not unlikely but they, who took before other their own Supper, took before other in their reſpective par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties the ſacred Myſteries alſo, and ſo did yet more nearly offend againſt the ſanctity of that Sacrament, and gave occaſion to St. <hi>Paul</hi> to tell them, that <hi>that was not to eat</hi> of it. But let us ſuppoſe that that was not the fault of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> but only their taking before other their own ſupper only; Yet will not that hinder but St. <hi>Paul</hi> might tell them, that that was <hi>not to eat the Lord's Supper,</hi> yea though he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood only the <hi>Sacrament</hi> thereof. Becauſe, ſecondly, thoſe <hi>Agapae,</hi> or <hi>Love-feaſts</hi> (if it be lawful ſo to call the Feaſts of theſe <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>) being joyned with the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, did by that very conjunction of theirs caſt a blemiſh upon that Sacrament, wherewith they were ſo conjoyn'd. And what then ſhould hinder St. <hi>Paul</hi> from telling them, that <hi>that was not</hi> to <hi>eat</hi> the Sacrament of <hi>the Lord's Supper,</hi> but rather contrary to it, becauſe by that near con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of their's offering a particular affront to it? Which reaſon will be yet more valuable, if we conſider, Thirdly, That the principal end of theſe Men's coming together in the Church, yea to thoſe very <hi>Agapae</hi> in it, was to celebrate the Sacrament, and other ſuch exerciſes of piety, and devotion. For being ſo, what was found to be contrary to that end was ſo much the more neceſſary to be taken notice of, and they, who were guilty of it (as they ought to be) reproached with it.</p>
                     <p>But why ſtand I ſo long to prove that we may underſtand St. <hi>Paul</hi> in that place of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, yea though what is ſaid concerning it relate more immediately to the abuſe of their <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pae?</hi> For there wants not reaſon enough to believe, that we ought to underſtand St. <hi>Paul</hi> of it, as well as have liberty to do ſo. Partly, becauſe that title belongs not at all to thoſe Love-feaſts, as being not inſtituted by Chriſt, but taken up, as is probable, in imitation
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:56517:125"/>of the Jews, who celebrated their Euchariſt at Feaſts, or in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our Saviour's celebrating his at the Feaſt of the Paſſover; But more eſpecially becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> preſſeth the <hi>Corinthians</hi> there with the firſt inſtitution of the Euchariſt<note n="(e)" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.23.</note>, and calls upon them to reflect upon, and conſider it. For to what purpoſe all that, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs that were the Lord's Supper he ſpake of before, and which he affirm'd their practice to be contrary to the due eating of? And I ſhall only add, that as that notion of the Lord's Supper is the more reaſonable to be embraced here, becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> but juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note n="(f)" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.21.</note> repreſented this Sacrament as the <hi>Table of the Lord;</hi> So there was reaſon enough for the impoſition of that name upon it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we do conſider it as a Feaſt, a Supper-feaſt, or a Supper-feaſt of the Lord: Becauſe intended as a Communion of that Body, and Blood, by which we are to be nouriſhed to eternal life, inſtituted at firſt at Supper time, and both inſtituted by, and intended for a Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of our Lord.</p>
                     <p>Next to the name of the Lord's Supper, reckon we that of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> or <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> for ſo the word <hi>Euchariſt</hi> imports. A name thought to have been given to it in the time of the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel of the New Teſtament, but however following cloſe after it. For thus they are wont to interpret what we find in St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <note n="(g)" place="margin">1 Cor. 14.16, 17.</note>, where he diſputes againſt praying in an unknown tongue. <hi>Elſe when thou ſhalt bleſs with the Spirit, how ſhall he that occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the room of the unlearned ſay Amen at thy</hi> Euchariſt, or <hi>giving of thanks, ſeeing he underſtandeth not what thou ſayeſt? For thou verily giveſt thanks,</hi> or celebrateſt the Euchariſt <hi>well, but the other is not edified.</hi> Where we have not only the words <gap reason="foreign">

However that be, moſt certain it is that this name of <hi>Euchariſt</hi> followed preſently upon thoſe times, as appears by the familiar uſe of it in <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Epiſtles. For thus he tells us in one place<note n="(h)" place="margin">Ep. ad Smyrn. <hi>pag. 5.</hi> ed Voſſ.</note>, That certain hereticks <hi>abſtain'd from the Euchariſt, and prayer, becauſe they confeſs'd not the Euchariſt to be the fleſh of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And preſently after<note n="(i)" place="margin">

Having thus completed the prayers, and</hi> Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, <hi>all the people preſent ſignifie their Aſſent to it by an</hi> Amen, <hi>which in the Hebrew Tongue is as much as, So be it.

And this Food</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is among us called the Euchariſt,</hi> to wit becauſe of the Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings before remembred.

                     <p>I may not forget to add, becauſe that ſeems as antient as any, that the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper was alſo known by the name of <hi>breaking of Bread;</hi> Not only the <hi>Syriack</hi> verſion, but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon alſo obliging us ſo to underſtand St. <hi>Luke,</hi> where he tells us that the firſt Converts of the Apoſtles<note n="(n)" place="margin">Acts 2.42.</note>

Leſt <hi>Marcion</hi> ſeeing

                     <p>But becauſe the foremention'd <hi>Baronius</hi> tells us that the Sacrament, whereof we ſpeak, had alſo the name of an <hi>Oblation,</hi> or <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> as that too becauſe of the <hi>offering</hi> there made for ſin, or an expiatory one; Therefore it will be neceſſary for us to go on to enquire into that name, and ſo much the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſame Author is ſo copious in his Quotations concerning it. And I readily grant that this Sacrament is frequently ſo call'd by the Antients, but that it was call'd ſo for the reaſon alledg'd, is utterly deny'd, neither can there be produc'd any convincing proof of it. The utmoſt, that is ſaid by thoſe, who are the moſt antient, is, that it is an <hi>Euchariſtical</hi> oblation, as that too <hi>for the bleſſings of this World,</hi> and particularly for <hi>the fruits of the earth,</hi> as well as for the <hi>bleſſing of our Redemption.</hi> And to that purpoſe, and no other are the ſayings before quoted out of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Origen.</hi> Which how they agree with their deſigns, who repreſent this Sacrament as an expiatory <hi>Oblation,</hi> or <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> I ſhall leave to all indifferent Men to judge.

                        <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 4. <hi>Diſt.</hi> 12.

To this it may be ſaid in ſhort, that that, which is offer'd, and conſecrated by the Prieſt, is called a Sacrifice, and Oblation; Becauſe it is the Memorial, and Repreſentation of the true Sacrifice, and the Holy Offering that was made upon the Croſs. And Chriſt died once upon the Croſs, and was there offered in himſelf. But he is every day offered in the Sacrament, becauſe in the Sacrament a remembrance is made of that, which was once done. Whereupon St.</hi> Auguſtine: <hi>We are aſſur'd that Chriſt riſing from the dead doth not now die any more,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Yet leſt we ſhould forget what was once done, it is every year done in our memory, to wit, as often as the Paſchal Feaſt is celebrated. Is Chriſt then ſo often kill'd? But only an anniverſary Remembrance repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents what was heretofore done, and ſo cauſeth us to be mov'd, as if we ſaw the Lord upon the Croſs.</hi> This, and more doth that Author alledge out of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> which ſhews what notion they, as well as he, had of this Sacrament's being alſo a Sacrifice. And if they, who inſiſt ſo much upon its having been intituled a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> will content themſelves with this, and the former ſenſe, we will allow that they have the <hi>Fathers</hi> on their ſide, but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to have no title to them in this affair.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall not need to ſay much concerning the name <hi>Miſſa,</hi> or <hi>Maſs,</hi> though that hath for a long time been appropriated to the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper: Partly, becauſe antiently it was common to other ſervices with it, and nothing therefore, that is ſingular, to be inferr'd therefrom toward the clearing of the nature of this; And partly, becauſe it had its Original, not (as <hi>Baronius</hi> would have it) from the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> or <hi>Chaldee</hi> word <hi>Miſſah,</hi> which he ſaith is us'd<note n="(w)" place="margin">

If in tract of time the word <hi>Miſſa,</hi> or <hi>Maſs</hi> came to be reſtrain'd to the ſervice of the Lord's Supper, it was in all probability becauſe as the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the <hi>Catechumens</hi> wore out<note n="(y)" place="margin">Cave's Primit.

                        </note> ſhall I ſay, or rather with this perverſe interpretation of it. <hi>In which Supper</hi> (ſpeaking of that of the Paſchal Lamb) <hi>that ineffable Sacrament was inſtituted, whereby Tranſubſtantiation was made of Bread, and Wine into the Fleſh, and Blood of Chriſt, into the very body of Chriſt entire under both ſpecies. Then alſo the Apoſtles, when the Lord commanded them to do the very ſame thing in remembrance of him, were made Prieſts, and that very ſacrifice, which they ſhould offer, was ordain'd.</hi> A Man would have thought that, whatever interpretation he had afterwards made of it, one, who pretended to be an Hiſtorian, ſhould at leaſt have given a more particular, and perfect account of that whole action, and, as near to as might be in the words of ſome of thoſe Holy Men, that had tranſmitted it to poſterity. And ſo no doubt this Hiſtorian would have done, if there had not been ſomewhat in the words of the Inſtitution, to which the practice of his Church had made a <hi>non obſtante</hi> to be neceſſary. But as he ſaw but too well how ill the practice of his Church anſwer'd what was then done, and enjoyn'd by our Saviour; ſo he therefore choſe rather to give that imperfect, as well as inſincere account of it, and endeavour to ſupply what was wanting by an account of thoſe <hi>names,</hi> which were antiently given to this Sacrament, with the declarations of the Antient <hi>Fathers</hi> concerning them. God be thanked we of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> are under no ſuch neceſſity of either ſlightly paſſing over, or any way perverting the Story of this Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. And therefore being now by the order of my diſcourſe to entreat of the Inſtitution of it, I will ſet down the Story there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the words of thoſe, that firſt deliver'd it, and bound my Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations by them.</p>

                     <p>Now the firſt thing I ſhall take notice of in the Hiſtory of this Sacrament is the <hi>Time</hi> of the Inſtitution of it. Which we learn from St. <hi>Paul</hi> to have been <hi>the ſame night, in which he was betray'd,</hi> from the context of the ſeveral <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> at the Celebration of the Feaſt of the Paſſover, or rather toward the cloſe of it; It being <hi>whilſt they were</hi> yet <hi>eating,</hi> that two of them affirm, that he took the Bread of it, and bleſs'd, and brake, and gave it, but ſo near the concluſion of that Feaſt, that St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> tell us, that it was <hi>after Supper</hi> before he took the Cup, and gave thanks over it, and gave it to his Diſciples. And though I do not pretend to affirm, neither do I know any ſober Man that doth, that there is any obligation upon us for celebrating it after Supper, or any other Meal: Our Saviour's celebrating it then being in compliance with thoſe Jews, whoſe Inſtitution he now tranſcrib'd, and reform'd, and probably alſo to intimate its ſucceeding to that ſolemnity: Tho I acknowledg it to have been an antient uſage<note n="*" place="margin">Tert. de Cor. <hi>cap.3.</hi>
                        </note> in the Church to celebrate it at their Meetings before day, and, where it was not ſo ſoon, yet before<note n="†" place="margin">Aug. Epiſt. <hi>119.</hi> ad Janu.</note> their eating of any thing elſe, as that too out of reſpect to that Sacrament; Yet I ſee as little reaſon to grant, that there is any more of religion in receiving it <hi>faſting,</hi> than what the cuſtom of the Church, or the Laws of decency give it: It being not otherwiſe to be thought, that our Saviour would have inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it at Supper time, or rather preſently after it; And much leſs, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have given it in command to the <hi>Corinthians</hi>
                        <note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.34.</note>, that <hi>if any Man hungred, he ſhould eat at home</hi> before he came to the participation of it, and of thoſe <hi>Agapae,</hi> that attended it.</p>
                     <p>From the <hi>Time</hi> of the Inſtitution paſs we to the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> it ſelf, and the ſeveral things done, and ſaid in it.</p>
                     <p>Where the firſt thing I am to take notice of is Chriſt's <hi>taking Bread,</hi> to wit into his hands, and probably from off that table, on which it was plac'd; Agreeably to that uſance of the Jews, which he fram'd his own Euchariſt by, and where (as was before<note n="*" place="margin">Part 1.</note> obſerv'd) the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Family held it in both his hands, whil'ſt he us'd the words of Conſecration, or Bleſſing over it. However, he ſo took it, to be ſure, as to ſeparate it from what other Bread then was upon the Table, as which the word <hi>took,</hi> in the moſt ſimple notion of it, will oblige us to believe; This importing the choice of ſome particular Bread from out the reſt, and leaving the other to the ordinary uſes of it. Now the Bread, which our Saviour thus took, was either ſome whole Loaf of Bread, anſwerably to the former uſance, or at leaſt ſome larger, but entire piece of one, as appears by the breaking of it into ſeveral pieces anſwerably to the ſeveral perſons, that were to partake of it. And it was alſo, agreeably to the time when it was made uſe of, <hi>unleavened</hi> Bread, as the <hi>Latines</hi> have truly obſerv'd againſt the Greeks; It being upon <hi>the firſt day of the feaſt of unleavened Bread,</hi> as three of the Evangeliſts<note n="†" place="margin">Mat. 26.17. Mark 14.12. Luke 22.7.</note> have obſerv'd, that that Paſſover, which immediately preceded this Sacrament, was celebrated, and conſequently that this Sacrament alſo was. But why it ſhould be ſo far urged againſt the Greeks, as to make it the matter of a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, is a very unaccountable thing, unleſs there were ſomewhat ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the words, or in the rites of the Inſtitution, which directed to the uſe of unleavened Bread only. For leavened, or unleavened
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:56517:131"/>matters not after the taking away of that Law, which made the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; And much leſs, where the preſent Law requires only<note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Cor. 5.8.</note> the laying aſide of the leaven of malice, and wickedneſs, and keeping our Paſſover feaſt with the unleavened Bread of ſincerity, and truth.</p>
                     <p>It followeth in the Story, And Jeſus took Bread, and <hi>bleſſed</hi> (as St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and St. <hi>Mark</hi> deliver it) or (as St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> after him) <hi>gave thanks.</hi> A thing, which will require a more accurate conſideration, becauſe of the momentouſneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; It being to that Bleſſing, or Thankſgiving probably that we are to aſſign that both change in it, and effects of it, which are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards attributed to it. That therefore we may the better underſtand this whether Bleſſing, or Thankſgiving, we will conſider the words apart, and firſt Chriſt's being ſaid to <hi>bleſs,</hi> or bleſs <hi>it,</hi> even the Bread.</p>
                     <p>For the better underſtanding of which word we are to know, that though to <hi>bleſs</hi> ſimply conſidered may as well refer to God, as to the <hi>thing,</hi> over which that Bleſſing is made; Yet we are in reaſon to underſtand it here, as relating to the <hi>Bread,</hi> as our Tranſlators in the ſtory of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> plainly do, becauſe adding the word <hi>it</hi> to <hi>bleſſed:</hi> And Jeſus took Bread, and bleſſed <hi>it.</hi> And my reaſon is firſt, becauſe <hi>bleſſed</hi> being a <hi>tranſitive</hi> verb, it is by the common rules of conſtruction to refer to that noun ſubſtantive, that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately preceded it, even the Bread, and not to any remoter one, or to one that is not expreſs'd. How much more then if thoſe verbs, which follow, even <hi>brake,</hi> and <hi>gave</hi> do alſo refer to it, as they, who make <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum</hi> the words of Conſecration, muſt neceſſarily allow? For what can be more congruous than to believe, when the verb <hi>bleſſed</hi> is a <hi>tranſitive</hi> one, that it referrs to the ſame noun ſubſtantive, even <hi>Bread,</hi> to which the foregoing verb <hi>took,</hi> and the following ones <hi>brake,</hi> and <hi>gave</hi> do? But that, which is no doubt of much more force in this affair, and will more determine the verb <hi>bleſſed</hi> to <hi>Bread,</hi> is the uſe of the ſame word in St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <note n="(b)" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.16.</note>, when applied to the Cup of the Sacrament, as it ſeems to be to the <hi>Bread</hi> here. For by the ſame reaſon that the <hi>Cup</hi> is there affirmed to be <hi>bleſſed</hi> by thoſe, that adminiſtred it, and not only ſo, but intimated to be call'd <hi>the Cup of Bleſſing</hi> for that reaſon; by the ſame reaſon are we to underſtand the word <hi>bleſſed</hi> here to relate to the <hi>Bread</hi> of it, and that our Saviour really <hi>bleſſed</hi> it, as well as <hi>bleſſed God,</hi> or gave <hi>thanks to God</hi> over it. And thus far we have the accord of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> it ſelf<note n="*" place="margin">Seſſ. <hi>13. cap. 1.</hi> Ita enim Majores noſtri omnes, &amp;c. apertiſſimè profeſſi ſunt hoc tam admirabi'e Sacramentum in ultimâ coenâ Redemptorem noſtrum inſtituiſſe, cum poſt panis, &amp; vini benedictionem ſe ſuumque ipſius corpus illis praebere, ac ſuum ſang uintem diſertis, ac perſpicuis verbis teſtatus eſt.</note>, becauſe applying the Bleſſing here ſpoken of to the Bread, yea affirming our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to have bleſſed the Wine as well, as that.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bread</hi> therefore being the thing, which our Saviour is ſaid to have <hi>bleſſed,</hi> enquire we in the next place what is meant by his <hi>bleſſing</hi> it. Which muſt be learn'd in part from the nature of that <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> wherewith it was bleſſed by him, and in part alſo from the <hi>intereſt,</hi> which our Saviour had in the beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. Now what the nature of that <hi>Bleſſing</hi> was, wherewith the Bread was bleſſed by him, will appear, if we conſider for what end it was appointed by him, who ſo took, and bleſſed it. Which we learn from the Inſtitution it ſelf, and from St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Comment
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:56517:132"/>upon it, to be in an eſpecial manner for the <hi>communion of his Body.</hi> For the deſign of the divine Bleſſing being to make the thing bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be uſeful for that end, for which it was appointed; If the Communion of the Body of Chriſt was the end, for which the Bread of the Lord's Supper was appointed, the Bleſſing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it was bleſſed, muſt conſequently conſiſt in its uſefulneſs for that end, or ends, for which it was ſo appointed by him. Which will leave nothing more to us to account for, than the intereſt, which our Saviour had in beſtowing that Bleſſing on it. Now, what that is may appear from the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or giving of Thanks, which St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> make uſe of to expreſs the ſame thing, as St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and St. <hi>Matthew</hi> alſo do to expreſs the Bleſſing of the Cup. For the word <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, or giving of Thanks importing him, to whom it is attributed, to addreſs himſelf unto another, Our Saviour muſt be ſuppos'd to have acted in the bleſſing of that Bread, not as one, who conferr'd that Bleſſing upon it himſelf, but as one, who addreſs'd himſelf to another for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing of it, even to him, to whom he gave Thanks. Which Particular may the more eaſily be believ'd, becauſe when he only bleſs'd the <hi>five Loaves,</hi> and <hi>two Fiſhes,</hi> to give Nouriſhment to that five thouſand Men, whom he meant to refreſh, he <hi>look'd up to Heaven</hi>
                        <note n="(c)" place="margin">Luke 9.16.</note> at the very inſtant of it, which ſhews from whence he look'd for the beſtowing of it, even from his <hi>Father,</hi> that was there. The reſult of the Premiſſes is this: Our Saviour being now about to appoint the <hi>Bread</hi> of the Lord's Supper for a Communion of his Body, and other ſuch ſacramental Purpoſes, addreſs'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Father (from whom every good and perfect Gift co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth) to make the Bread, which he now took, uſeful for thoſe Purpoſes, or (that I may ſpeak in the language of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and St. <hi>Mark</hi>) to bleſs it for them. With what kind of Addreſs, or Addreſſes, will beſt be learn'd by that <hi>word,</hi> which St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> made uſe of to expreſs that action of his, even the word <gap reason="foreign">

Which if we guide our ſelves by, we ſhall find this
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:56517:132"/>Thankſgiving of our Saviour to have been for the giving of him to die for the Redemption of ſinful Man, and other the like ends of his Death. For requiring his Diſciples afterwards to do what he had done for the remembrance of him, and particularly of the <hi>breaking</hi> of his Body for them, he muſt conſequently be ſuppoſed to have given Thanks to God for giving him for thoſe gracious Purpoſes, as which was the chief deſign of the whole, and which could not be remembred, as it ought, without ſuch a Thankſgiving for it. I think it as reaſonable to conclude, ſecondly, that our Saviour gave Thanks alſo for directing himſelf (who ſpake, and did what he did by Authority from the Father) to this Element of Bread for the <hi>Communion</hi> of his Body to his Diſciples, and Followers: This, as it was by the Inſtitution it ſelf to be a means of the Communion of his Body, and ſo much the more comfortable one too, becauſe it was alſo manifeſt to their Senſes; So being a like object of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to him, who had eſpous'd his Diſciples intereſt as his own, and to thoſe Diſciples that were to be profited by it, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not to be thought to have been forgotten by him. Theſe <hi>two</hi> great Benefits I think, and I ſuppoſe not without reaſon, to have been the Benefits our Saviour gave Thanks for, and poſſibly alſo ſuch Benefits as were preparatory to our Saviour's Death, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly his Conception, and Birth. But other Benefits than thoſe I know no ground to believe, and much leſs the creation of this, and other the Fruits of the Earth, and diſpenſing them to us by his Providence. As becauſe there is not the leaſt ground in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution for ſuch a Thankſgiving unto God; So becauſe this, and the other Element of the Lord's Supper were appointed not for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, but ſpiritual ſuſtenance, and to which therefore our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Thanksſgiving, and ours may ſeem more properly to referr, and becauſe too there is appearance enough from what was before ſaid from St. <hi>Luke</hi>
                        <note n="(d)" place="margin">Luke 22.17.</note> concerning our Saviour's taking a Cup of Wine, giving Thanks, and diſtributing it among his Diſciples immediately before the Inſtitution of this Sacrament, that he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied the Jewiſh Euchariſt before, even that, which had for its end the giving Thanks to God for earthly Benefits, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly for the means of our Repaſt. If the Antients (as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears they did<note n="(e)" place="margin">Part 1.</note>) repreſented this Sacrament as an Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt for the Fruits of the Earth, as well as for the Bleſſing of our Redemption, and accordingly premis'd ſuch kind of Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings for it; I am apt to think it proceeded at firſt from its being accompanied, or rather immediately preceded (as that, which our Saviour firſt celebrated, was) by the Euchariſt of the <hi>Jews;</hi> And, when that <hi>Euchariſt</hi> was laid aſide, from a Willingneſs in the Chriſtians, that followed them, to conform their own Euchariſt <hi>ſo far</hi> to that of the Jews, ſo the better to gain them to their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or oblige them to keep cloſely to it. Till at length what was done only out of compliance with the Jews, came to be look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a neceſſary part of the Chriſtian Euchariſt, and Men thought themſelves obliged to give Thanks to God in it for the <hi>Fruits</hi> of the Earth, as well as for the Bleſſing of our <hi>Redemption.</hi> Which Opinion the Antients were the more eaſily perſwaded into, becauſe Chriſtianity<note n="†" place="margin">1 Tim. 4.4.</note>, as well as Judaiſm taught them, before their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:56517:133"/>Repaſts, to give God Thanks for the Matter of them, and ſo ſanctifie the Uſe thereof unto themſelves. For that might tempt them farther to believe, that our Saviour premis'd ſuch a Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving to his Euchariſt, and conſequently thereto that we ought to do the like. If any Man can give a fairer account of the Antients both Opinion and Practice, I, who profeſs my ſelf to have a juſt regard for them, will be glad to receive it, and (which is more) will be as willing to acknowledge my own Errour in the former one. But till I ſee ſuch an account, I ſhall reſt ſatisfied in this, and ſo much the more willingly, becauſe they, who urge ſuch like Teſtimonies of the Antients to eſtabliſh the Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſs,</hi> inſiſt as little upon this ſort of Thankſgivings, as any of the Reformed do.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But to return to that, from which I have diverted, even to that Euchariſt, or Thankſgiving, which our Saviour us'd over the Bread of it. Where the next thing to be enquir'd into is, what Uſe that Thankſgiving may be ſuppoſed to be of to procure the bleſſing of the Bread. For if our Saviour bleſſed the Bread by the Thanksſgiving, which he made over it, or rather addreſs'd himſelf to God by Thankſgiving for the bleſſing of it; That Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving muſt be ſuppos'd to be of ſome uſe to procure the Divine Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on it. For the clearing of which Difficulty they, who alledge, as ſome do, that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or Thankſgiving is ſet to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note <hi>Prayer,</hi> as well as that, and ſo far forth may be of ſufficient force to procure the Divine Bleſſing (For what is there, that can be ſuppos'd to be deny'd to Prayer, and particularly to the Prayer of him, in whom God was well pleaſed?) ſuch Men, I ſay, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that, which may perhaps be true, and which I ſhall by and by endeavour to confirm. But withall they ſay that, which will not reach the Difficulty, nor give any good account of two <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s expreſſing this Addreſs of Chriſt to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or <hi>giving of thanks.</hi> For whatever elſe that <hi>word</hi> may be thought to include in it, manifeſt it is, firſt, that Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving is the primary notion of it, and <hi>that</hi> therefore in it ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd of a peculiar uſe toward the procuring of the Divine Bleſſing, as which otherwiſe would not have been employ'd to denote the whole Act. As manifeſt it is, ſecondly, that the Bleſſings<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Grot.</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.26.</note> of the <hi>Jews</hi> before, and after their Meals were generally Thankſgivings, and particularly that Bleſſing was, wherewith the <hi>Jews</hi> Euchariſt was begun, and clos'd. It is manifeſt, thirdly, that Thankſgivings have always had a great part in the conſecrating of our Euchariſt, and is deny'd by no Man, that I know of, that will allow Prayer to have any part in it. Which ſuppos'd, the Queſtion will ſtill return, what uſe they may be ſuppoſed to be of toward the procuring of the Divine Bleſſing, and which we muſt find out ſome other way to reſolve. In order whereunto I will conſider theſe Thankſgivings firſt as to what is <hi>common</hi> to them with all others, and then as to what is <hi>peculiar</hi> to them, as preparatory to our partaking of what we ſo give Thanks for. That, which the Thankſgivings of the Euchariſt have <hi>common</hi> to them with all others, is, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that in them, which I have elſewhere<note n="(f)" place="margin">Expl. of the Lord's Prayer. Diſcourſe 2. Introd.</note> ſhewn makes Prayer it ſelf to be ſo acceptable, even an acknowledgment of our dependance upon God: He, who thanks God for the Benefits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56517:133"/>in it, or for this ſenſible conveyance of them, as much acknowledging his dependance upon God, as he, who ſues to him for thoſe Benefits, or any other. And well may that be thought to be of uſe toward the procuring of the Divine Bleſſing, which is as much an acknowledgment of our dependance upon him, as any Prayer whatſoever. Of ſuch uſe are the Thankſgivings of the Euchariſt toward the procuring of the Divine Bleſſing on it, when conſider'd as to that, which is <hi>common</hi> to them with all others. How much more, when conſider'd as to that, which is <hi>peculiar</hi> to them as preparatory to our partaking of what we ſo give Thanks for? To give Thanks by way of preparation to the partaking of any Benefit implying an apprehenſion in him, that gives it, of the neceſſity of the Divine Bleſſing to make it uſeful to him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently thereto a Deſire of, and Prayer to God for the beſtowing of it. By which means the Thankſgivings of the Euchariſt, and particularly thoſe, which our Saviour made over the Bread of it, will be though not expreſs, yet tacit Prayers to God for his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on it, and conſequently of yet more force to procure that Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing for it, and for thoſe, that are to partake of it. Only becauſe the Bleſſings mention'd in the Scripture were oftentimes<note n="(g)" place="margin">Gen. 17.28. Num. 6.23.</note> Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God for his Bleſſing, and it is hard to believe that, when our Saviour deſign'd the Bleſſing of the Euchariſt, he ſhould not ſeek to God for it by an <hi>expreſs</hi> Prayer, as well as by Thankſgivings, and tacit ones, I think it but juſt to enquire,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Whether our Saviour's Thankſgiving did not alſo contain in it ſome <hi>expreſs Requeſt</hi> to God for the granting of that Bleſſing, which he deſir'd. For the clearing whereof we are to know, that as it is not unuſual for that <hi>word,</hi> which ſignifies only one noted part of a thing, to be ſet to denote the other alſo (For thus, as was before obſerv'd, the <hi>Bread</hi> of this Sacrament, and the <hi>breaking</hi> of the Bread is ſet to denote the <hi>Wine,</hi> as well as the <hi>Bread,</hi> and all that is done to <hi>both</hi> of them, as well as the <hi>breaking</hi> of one Element thereof) ſo St. <hi>Paul</hi>

Of which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in particular was the momentouſneſs of that Bleſſing, which he now ſought, and which may ſeem no way unworthy of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Prayer to the Father for it; The ſame Chriſt's alſo employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Prayers on leſs weighty occaſions, as well as upon more

Under which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation yet they muſt in no wiſe have been, if Chriſt, whom they are requir'd to imitate, offer'd no Supplications to his Father to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from him the working of ſo great a change in the outward Elements. I take no notice here, becauſe I may have a more proper place for it, of the Antients ſending up Prayers, as well as Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings, when they ſet themſelves to the bleſſing of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And ſhall only add, That though Prayers, as well as Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings had a place in this Affair, yet the latter might be both more particularly inculcated, and more often mentioned, becauſe more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently agreeable to that thankful Remembrance of Chriſt's death, which this Sacrament was in an eſpecial manner ordained for.</p>
                     <p>The next thing, that our Saviour did, and we are accordingly to take notice of, was the <hi>breaking</hi> of the Bread; For ſo it follows in the Story, And Jeſus took Bread, and bleſſed, and brake <hi>it,</hi> even the Bread: Not only our own Tranſlation obliging us ſo to underſtand the ſeveral <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> by its ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word <hi>it,</hi> but the coherence of theſe words with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and (which is more) the expreſs Authority of Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <note n="(k)" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.16.</note> elſewhere; He there deſcribing this part of the Sacrament un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the title of <hi>the Bread, which we break,</hi> and ſo ſhewing <hi>Bread</hi> to be the ſubject of it. Now this Bread our Saviour brake partly in conformity to what was done to that of the Jewiſh Euchariſt, and partly that he might the better ſerve his own purpoſes in this. For ſo careful were the <hi>Jews</hi> in the breaking of their Euchariſtical Bread, that whereas thoſe thicker Loaves<note n="(l)" place="margin">Caſſand. Liturgic. in initio.</note>, which they made uſe of, could not conveniently be broken in pieces, he, who bleſſed the Bread did, before that Benediction of his, cut one part almoſt from the remaining piece, but ſo, that it ſtill ſtuck to it, and after that Benediction of his, brake it off, and when he had again cut leſſer Particles out of that, took one himſelf, and gave the reſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Gueſts. In conformity to which Cuſtom as it is reaſonable to believe, that our Saviour in part proceeded, when he brake that Bread, which he had before bleſſed; So more eſpecially, that he might the better ſerve his own Purpoſes in it, even the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of it to his Diſciples, and the repreſentation of the breaking of his Body upon the Croſs. The former whereof St. <hi>Paul</hi> plainly intimates where he asks, <hi>The Bread whith we break, is it not the Communion of the Body of Chriſt?</hi> The latter, when in his rehearſal of the words of the Inſtitution he brings in our Saviour ſaying, <hi>This is my Body</hi> which is <hi>broken</hi> for you: There being not otherwiſe any reaſon, why he ſhould attribute the term of <hi>breaking</hi> to Chriſt's Body, but that the breaking of the Bread, which was a Figure of it, was intended to repreſent that violence, which was offer'd to
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:56517:134"/>his crucified one. And though it be true that none of the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts</hi> give any ſuch hint of this Myſtery of the <hi>breaking</hi> of the Bread, becauſe affirming only <hi>This is my Body,</hi> as St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and St. <hi>Mark</hi> do, or This is my Body, <hi>which is given for you,</hi> as St. <hi>Luke;</hi> Yet as they all ſay enough to ſhew, that this Sacrament of Bread and Wine was intended for a Repreſentation of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Paſſion, and the violence that was then offer'd to his cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Body; ſo they do thereby ſufficiently intimate, that the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Bread was intended as a Repreſentation of it: There being nothing in the Bread to repreſent this to us, but only the breaking of it. This however is evident, that our Saviour <hi>brake</hi> that Bread, which he before <hi>took,</hi> and <hi>bleſſed.</hi> And that Rite of <hi>breaking</hi> was afterwards look'd upon as ſo conſiderable, that it gave Name to the Sacrament it ſelf, and the whole of it from that one Rite, entituled, <hi>The breaking of Bread.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our Saviour having thus taken, and bleſſed and broken Bread (for thus far to be ſure we have Bread, whatever we have beſide) he proceeds to give it to his Diſciples; For ſo the three <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> aſſure us: Not that the Original of thoſe Evangeliſts hath any thing in it to expreſs the <hi>thing</hi> given, but that it ſpeaks of his gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſomewhat to them, and which, conſidering the connexion of this Act of Chriſt with the former ones, cannot reaſonably be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of any other than the Bread, which he had before taken, and bleſſed, and broken. And though St. <hi>Paul</hi> take no notice of this <hi>Gift</hi> of our Saviour's in the rehearſal he makes of this his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; Yet he ſufficiently intimates it, when he brings him in ſaying, <hi>Take, Eat, This is my Body,</hi> &amp;c. His willing them to take, and eat, implying his parting with it, that they might partake of it. This however is manifeſt from the Evangeliſts, that what our Saviour before took, and bleſſed, and brake, he gave to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and I ſuppoſe to each of the Diſciples in particular, and by reaching it forth unto them; The former being the manner of that Euchariſt, by which he fram'd his own, Both the one, and the other the Ancient Practice of the Church, whether by the Hands of him that bleſſed it, or of thoſe Deacons that miniſtred to him.</p>
                     <p>I will not ſpend time in animadverting upon the words <hi>Take, Eat,</hi> which he us'd with the giving of the Bread. It may ſuffice to ſay as to the former of theſe, that as it is, and always was the manner of Gueſts to take or receive into their hands, or in ſome plate, which they held in them, what was given to them by another; ſo the Antients knew no other taking, or receiving of this Bread, than that, which was performed by them. As little need to be ſaid concerning that <hi>eating,</hi> which our Saviour ſubjoin'd to the Command of <hi>taking,</hi> or receiving what he gave them; Unleſs there could be any doubt of that's being <hi>Bread,</hi> which was now to be eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by them. For as what it is to eat Bread is ſufficiently known, even after we have put it into our mouths to chew it there, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it from thence into our Stomachs for the nouriſhment of our Bodies; So that it was Bread, which they were commanded to eat, St. <hi>Paul</hi> plainly ſhews in the words<note n="(m)" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.26, 27.</note>, which he ſubjoins to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of this Sacrament: He affirming the worthy Receiver of the Euchariſt to eat Bread, as well as the moſt unworthy one.</p>

                     <p>To go on therefore to thoſe words, which our Saviour ſubjoyn'd to his Precept of <hi>taking,</hi> and <hi>eating,</hi> even thoſe moſt noted ones, <hi>This is my Body.</hi> Words, which the wanton Wits of Men have transform'd into many ſhapes, and thoſe too no leſs monſtrous, than what they deſign'd to inferr from them.

This</hi> is my Body.</p>
                     <p>Now that, which unprejudiced Men would undoubtedly think to be intended by the word <hi>This,</hi> was the <hi>Bread</hi> before ſpoken of, and which our Saviour is ſaid to have <hi>taken, bleſſed, broken,</hi> and given to his Diſciples with a deſign they ſhould take, and eat of it: Partly, becauſe that was the thing manifeſtly intended all along, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the common Rules of Conſtruction to be underſtood alſo here; And partly, becauſe the demonſtrative Particle <hi>This,</hi> muſt by the natural importance of it, be thought to point out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing certain, and apparent to them, which hitherto nothing but the Bread of the Sacrament was. Thus, I ſay, unprejudiced Men would be apt to think of the word <hi>This,</hi> though they had nothing to direct them, but the words of the Inſtitution. How much more then, if they ſhould reflect upon what St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <note n="(o)" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.26, 27.</note> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth to, and inferreth from them in the account he gives us of that Affair.

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable hereto, whether the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will, or no, is their own Opinion of the Bread's being tranſubſtantiated by the words, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> and that Tranſubſtantiation not effected, till the laſt Syllable of <hi>meum</hi> is pronounc'd. For if that Tranſubſtantiation be not effected till then, it muſt be <hi>Bread</hi> before the pronunciation of it, and the word <hi>This</hi> therefore denote no other than that <hi>Bread,</hi>

But is it then poſſible that ſo many wiſe Men ſhould be otherwiſe perſwaded without very great reaſon to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? And neither are they, as they ſurmiſe, becauſe the word, which we render <hi>This,</hi> is both in the <hi>Greek,</hi> and the <hi>Latin</hi> of a different <hi>Gender</hi> from the <hi>word,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Bread,</hi> and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of the ſame <hi>Gender</hi> with that <hi>Body,</hi> which it is afterwards affirm'd to be, even the <hi>Neuter</hi> one. As if on purpoſe to let us know, that the word <hi>This</hi> was intended to ſignifie no other, than This is my Body even now, or was in an Inſtant to be tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated into it.

                     <p>In the accounts which I have ſeen in ſome of our own Church concerning theſe words <hi>is my Body,</hi> I do not only find the words <hi>is</hi> and <hi>my Body</hi> commonly joyn'd together in their explanation of them, but I find it affirm'd alſo (where they enquire whether the predication be proper, or figurative) that it is indifferent whether we place the Figure in the word <hi>is,</hi> or in the words <hi>my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi> I muſt needs ſay, I do not think it ſo indifferent a thing, as they ſeem willing to believe, whether we have a regard to the words <hi>my Body,</hi> as they lie in the Text, or whether we have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the conſequents of a figurative interpretation of them. For (that I may ſpeak my mind freely, and clearly, as every honeſt Man ought to do in a matter of ſo great importance) I do not ſee how thoſe words, <hi>my Body,</hi> can be otherwiſe than literally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, even for that Body, which he was now about to offer upon the Croſs, and preſently after did offer up upon it for the Salvation of Mankind. For how could our Saviour, though he were never ſo diſpos'd to deſcribe that <hi>Body,</hi> how, I ſay, could he more clearly, and plainly deſcribe it, than by that Body, which was, or was ſhortly to be <hi>given,</hi> or <hi>broken</hi> for them? Eſpecially, when he immediately calls upon them to do, what he had now taught them, in remembrance of himſelf? For <hi>do this,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me.</hi> For was the Bread, which he affirms to be his Body, however bleſſed or broken, the thing that was given for them, or their ſalvation, and not rather that Body, which he now carried about him, and was ſhortly after to ſuffer in? Nay, doth not our Saviour's ſubjoyning to <hi>This is my Body, which is given,</hi> or <hi>broken for you,</hi> This do in remembrance of me, farther ſhew, that he meant that Body which was ſhortly to be given, or crucified for them? It being the Lord's <hi>Death,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets it<note n="(w)" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.26.</note> that they were to ſhew forth thereby, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that they were to do what they were now taught in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:56517:136"/>of <hi>him,</hi> and <hi>that.</hi> And indeed, as I do not therefore ſee, how we can honeſtly underſtand thoſe words <hi>my Body</hi> of any other, than that Body, which he now carried about him, and was ſhortly after to offer; So I am farther confirm'd in it by the evil conſequences of a figurative interpretation of them, which are theſe two eſpecially. Firſt, that we ſhall thereby leave no clear account in them, nor indeed in any of the words of the Inſtitution, of the thing ſignified by the Sacrament, and which all Men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be the Crucified Body of Chriſt; And ſecondly, that we ſhall give more countenance, than we are willing to do, to that <hi>propitiatory</hi> Sacrifice, which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> advance in this affair. For if by the words <hi>my Body</hi> be meant the memorial of Chriſt's Body, I do not ſee why we ſhould not in like manner at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to that memorial (as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> do,) its being <hi>given,</hi> or <hi>broken</hi> for us, and for our Salvation, and conſequently make it a propitiatory Sacrifice for us. Let it therefore be allow'd, or at leaſt till we ſee better reaſon to the contrary, that as by the word <hi>This</hi> we ought to underſtand <hi>This Bread,</hi> even the Bread, which our Saviour gave to his Diſciples, ſo we ought in like manner to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by the words <hi>my Body</hi> my <hi>Crucified</hi> one, that which I now carry about me, and am ſhortly after to offer up. Which will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently leave nothing more to enquire, than what our Saviour meant by the word <hi>[Is],</hi> and how the Bread before ſpoken <hi>was,</hi> and <hi>is</hi> that Body of Chriſt.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. But it may be though the word <hi>[Is]</hi> may ſometime be taken figuratively, yet there is no reaſon for taking it ſo here, or at leaſt no neceſſity for it; Therefore enquire we in the next place, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ought to be ſo taken here, or rather (becauſe I have already undertaken to demonſtrate it) endeavour to ſhew that it ought. Which I ſhall make it my buſineſs to evince <hi>Firſt,</hi> from the impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Propoſition's being true, if it be taken in the literal ſenſe; <hi>Secondly,</hi> from the ſutableneſs of the figurative ſenſe to the nature of that, which is the ſubject matter of it; <hi>Thirdly,</hi> from the fitneſs of the word <hi>[Is]</hi> to expreſs it.</p>
                     <p>That the Propoſition cannot be true, if the word <hi>[Is]</hi> be taken in the literal ſenſe, is evident from a known rule of Logick, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, even that <hi>two diſparates,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Bread,</hi> and a <hi>humane Body</hi> are, cannot properly be predicated of one another. For neither can <hi>Bread,</hi> continuing <hi>ſuch,</hi> be a humane Body, any more than it can be a Stone, or a Serpent, or any thing elſe; Or than a Mouſe can be a Lion, or Elephant, or the like. Which is ſo true, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſ'd, that they, who ſtand for the proper, and literal ſignification of the words, do not only ſome of them acknowledg it in expreſs terms, but indeed alſo both <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> and <hi>Lutherans</hi> offer a greater violence to them, for the avoiding of ſuch an abſurdity: The one by denying the word <hi>This</hi> to ſignifie <hi>This Bread,</hi> though that (as was before ſaid) were the only thing before ſpoken of, and the thing too, that was given to the Diſciples to eat, upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of it; The other, by repreſenting the ſenſe of it as being rather <hi>in this,</hi> or <hi>under this Bread</hi> is my Body, than <hi>This is my body,</hi> as the words import.</p>
                     <p>But beſide that the Propoſition cannot be true, if the word <hi>[Is]</hi> be taken in the literal ſenſe, and therefore of neceſſity to have a figurative one aſſigned to it; The figurative ſenſe is extremely ſutable to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that, which is the ſubject matter of it. For what is it (as was before obſerv'd) that our Saviour affirmed to be his Body, but that Bread, which he had before taken, and bleſſed, and broken? As that too not conſidered in its own natural being, or uſe, but as a Sacrament, or ſacred ſign of ſomething elſe, and particularly of the Body of Chriſt? Now what ſenſe, where there is any doubt of the meaning of a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition concerning that, can be more ſutable to it, than a figurative one? What more eaſy, or more adapted to the nature of it? And if there be none, what more reaſonable to be pitch'd upon, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed more neceſſary to be affixed to it? The ſenſe of words being no doubt to be fitted to the nature of thoſe things, which they are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by the ſpeaker thereof to denote.</p>
                     <p>But that, which will put the thing in controverſie yet more out of doubt, at leaſt among unprejudiced Men, is the fitneſs of the word <hi>[Is]</hi> to expreſs that figurative ſenſe, which we have affixed to it. For be it that the word <hi>[Is]</hi> denotes <hi>eſſence,</hi> or <hi>being,</hi> which is the utmoſt that can be made of it, by thoſe, who are for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſignification of it, and the other words; Yet is not that <hi>eſſence,</hi> or <hi>being</hi> to be adapted to the nature of that, to which it is affixt?
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:56517:137"/>Now wherein conſiſts the eſſence, or being of ſuch a relative thing, as a ſacred ſign, but in the relation which it bears to the thing ſignified, and conſequently in its ſignifying that, which it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to mark out? And if the eſſence, or being of a ſign con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the relation, which it bears to the thing ſignified, may it not, as ſuch, be ſaid to <hi>be</hi> that thing, which it is intended to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie? For who, if ask'd concerning this, or that Picture (as, for inſtance, the Picture of <hi>Alexander,</hi> or <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi>) would deſcribe it by a piece of Paper, or Cloath, or Wood, ſo, and ſo Painted, but as ſuch, or ſuch a perſon, who did ſuch admirable things in the World? Nay who is there that, when he ſees this, or that Picture, though he knows them to be but inanimate things, doth ſo much as ask, <hi>What it is,</hi> but <hi>Who?</hi> So naturally, and almoſt neceſſarily do Men take the very being of ſuch a thing to conſiſt in its relation to the perſon it repreſents, and accordingly do as naturally expreſs themſelves in that manner concerning it. And if that be the caſe as to other ſigns, why not in like manner as to this Sacred ſign of Chriſt's Body, the Bread? Eſpecially if (as I ſhall by and by ſhew) it hath a yet nearer relation to it. In order whereunto I will now proceed to ſhew,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. What the word <hi>[Is]</hi> imports in that figurative ſenſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we ſpeak. And here in the firſt place it is eaſie to obſerve, that the word <hi>[Is]</hi> imports that, to which it is attributed; even the Bread of the Sacrament, to be a ſign of that Body of Chriſt, which it is affirmed to be. Which I do not only affirm upon account of the notion that all Men have of it, but upon account of the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs there is between the Bread broken, and the Mortifying of our Saviour's Body, and upon account alſo of the ſame Body's being affirmed by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Hiſtory of the Inſtitution to be <hi>broken</hi> for us: There being otherwiſe no ground for that expreſſion as to the Body of Chriſt, but that the breaking of the Bread was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſignifie, or repreſent the injury, that was offer'd to Chriſt's Body, and conſequently that that Bread was ſo far forth intended as a ſign of it. Which is no more, than the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves, and particularly <hi>Eſtius,</hi> have ſaid in this affair, and therefore I ſhall not need to inſiſt upon it. I ſay, ſecondly, that as the word <hi>[Is]</hi> imports that, to which it is attributed, to be a ſign of Chriſt's Body, ſo alſo to be ſuch a ſign in particular, as was intended to bring Chriſt's Body, and the Crucifixion of it to our own Minds, or the Minds of others, or, in a word, to be a memorial of it: The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer being evident from our Saviour's enjoyning his Diſciples, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently upon theſe words, to do what he had now taught them in remembrance of himſelf; The latter from St. <hi>Paul's</hi> telling his <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> that <hi>as often as they ate that bread, and drank that cup, they did ſhew the Lord's death till he came.</hi> I ſay, thirdly, and laſtly, that the word <hi>[Is]</hi> doth likewiſe import that, to which it is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, to be a means of our partaking of the Body of Chriſt, as well as a ſign, or a memorial of it. Which we ſhall the leſs need to doubt, when St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.16.</note> doth in expreſs terms repreſent the Bread, which is broken in the Sacrament, as the <hi>Communion,</hi> or <hi>Communication</hi> of the Body of Chriſt, and the <hi>Cup of Bleſſing,</hi> which is bleſſed in it, as <hi>the Communion of his Blood.</hi> Now if a ſign, even
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:56517:138"/>where it is hardly ſuch, may be ſaid to be that, which it ſignifies; How much more ſuch a ſign, as is alſo by the Inſtitution of Chriſt a means of its conveyance, and of which whoſoever doth worthily partake, ſhall as verily partake together with it of the Body of Chriſt, and of the Benefits that accrue to us thereby?</p>
                     <p>I may not forget to add what St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> have added to the words <hi>This</hi> is my Body, even This is my Body, <hi>which is given for you,</hi> as the former; which is <hi>broken</hi> for you, as the latter: Both to the ſame purpoſe, though in different expreſſions, even to mark out to us more clearly how we are to conſider that Body, that is to ſay, as a crucified one; The <hi>giving</hi> of Chriſt, or his Body being ſometime expreſs'd by <hi>giving</hi> him for our ſins,<note n="(b)" place="margin">Gal. 1.4.</note> and at other times by <hi>giving him</hi>
                        <note n="(c)" place="margin">Tit. 2.10.</note> 
                        <hi>to redeem us from them,</hi> which we know by the ſame Scripture to have been compaſſed by his death. As indeed under what other notion can we conceive the <hi>giving</hi> of his Body, when it is not only conſider'd apart from his <hi>Blood,</hi> but that <hi>Blood</hi> afterward affirm'd to be <hi>ſhed</hi> for the remiſſion of ſins, and accordingly ſo requir'd to be conſider'd here. The expreſſion of St. <hi>Paul, which is broken for you,</hi> is yet more clear, becauſe more manifeſtly pointing out the violence, that was offer'd to Chriſt's Body; With this farther advantage, as was before ſaid, that it doth not obſcurely intimate the breaking of the Bread to have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to repreſent what was done unto his Body, and under what notion we are to conſider it. Though, to put it farther out of doubt, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> after his account of the Hiſtory of the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, affirms both the one, and the other Element of this Sacrament to relate to our Saviour's Death, and conſequently to reſpect his Body as <hi>mortiſt'd,</hi> as well as his Blood as <hi>ſhed:</hi> He relling his <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that he that did eat that Bread, as well as he, that drank that Cup, did thereby ſhew forth the Lord's <hi>Death</hi> till he came. Only if it be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd why our Saviour ſhould <hi>even then</hi> repreſent his Body as bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or given, when it was not to be ſo till the day after the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Sacrament; I anſwer partly, becauſe it was very ſhortly to be ſo, but more eſpecially becauſe he intended what he now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd as a preſcription for the time after his Death, as his willing his Diſciples to do this <hi>in remembrance</hi> of him doth manifeſtly imply: That importing the thing to be remembred to be <hi>paſt,</hi> and <hi>gone,</hi> as which otherwiſe could not be capable of being <hi>remembred.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It follows both in St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul, Do this,</hi> and Do this <hi>in remembrance of me.</hi> Words, which the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church hath pick'd ſtrange matters out of, even no leſs (as was before obſerv'd out of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi>) than the <hi>Prieſthood</hi> of the A poſtles, as which was collated upon them by theſe words, and the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the Maſs. For <hi>then alſo</hi> (ſaith that Author) <hi>the Apoſtles, when the Lord commanded them to do the very ſame thing in remembrance of him, were made Prieſts, and that very Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, which they ſhould offer, was ordain'd.</hi> By what Alchymie the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> and the <hi>Sacrifice of the Maſs</hi> are endeavour'd to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted out of theſe words, muſt be conſider'd in another place, where ſuch kind of queſtions will be more fit to be debated. At preſent it may ſuffice to ſay, that as it doth not appear from the Inſtitution, that our Saviour made any other Offering of his Body in the Symbol of Bread, than what he did to his Diſciples, nor indeed how he could,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56517:138"/>unleſs he meant both to prevent, and vacate the future Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of himſelf upon the Croſs, by which yet (as the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
                        <note n="(d)" place="margin">Heb. 10.14.</note> inſtructs us) <hi>he perfected for ever them, that are ſanctified;</hi> So it can much leſs therefore appear, how the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what Chriſt had before done, or taught them to do, could make the Apoſtles <hi>Prieſts,</hi> or the Celebration of this Sacrament to be a Sacrifice. All, that can be fairly deduced from the words <hi>Do this,</hi> and Do this <hi>in remembrance of me,</hi> is, that they ſhould for the future take Bread, bleſs it, and break it, and, when they had done ſo, both eat of it themſelves, and give it to others to eat of in remembrance of him, and of his Death. Or, if we ſhould think that the words <hi>Do this</hi> ought to have a nearer Antecedent, that they ſhould take, and eat what had been before taken, and bleſſed, and broken, and given to them by the Conſecrator of it in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him: That, as it is the thing, and the only thing juſt before enjoyn'd upon the Diſciples (For what he ſaith concerning the thing given them <hi>being</hi> his <hi>Body</hi> doth rather point out what regard they ought to have in the eating of it, to that Body, of which it was a Symbol, than any new injunction, or precept concerning it) ſo it is the thing, and the only thing therefore, which he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately referr'd to, when he ſaid, <hi>This do</hi> in remembrance of me. Which St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth yet more clearly inſinuate, when im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the Hiſtory of the Inſtitution, and which he clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in each Element with <hi>This Do</hi> in remembrance of me, he adds, as by way of explication of that paſſage, <hi>For as often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do ſhew the Lord's death till he come.</hi> This I take to be a clear, and natural account of what Chriſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd the Diſciples to do, and not any intimation at all either of the Apoſtles <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> or of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the Maſs. And what he adds concerning their <hi>doing</hi> what he now enjoyn'd them <hi>in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of him,</hi> agrees as well to it, becauſe (as appears from the words but now quoted) they were to <hi>eat of that Bread,</hi> as well as <hi>drink of that Cup</hi> with reference to him, and to his Death, or (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſeth it) to <hi>ſhew</hi> it forth. Which will conſequently leave nothing more to be conſider'd upon this Head, than what our Saviour means by <hi>in remembrance of him.</hi> Do this <hi>in remembrance of me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now as there cannot well be any doubt concerning the <hi>Object</hi> of this Remembrance, partly becauſe Chriſt doth here repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelf as the Object of it, and partly becauſe he repreſents himſelf throughout this whole Sacrament as giving himſelf to Death for us, and conſequently he to be conſider'd as ſuch in our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him: So I ſhall therefore need only to enquire what that <hi>remembrance</hi> of him doth import, and how the thing enjoyned to be done ſerves to the exciting of it.</p>
                     <p>Now there are two things again, which the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or <hi>remembrance</hi> ſignifies, and which we ſhall find upon enquiry that it ſignifies alſo here; The recalling that to our own mind, which is the Object of it, or recalling it to the mind of others: The former of theſe, as it is the moſt ſimple, and obvious notion of the word, ſo no doubt principally intended here, if Chriſt's giving his Body to death for us be the thing, wherein we are to remember him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are requir'd to take, and eat the Bread exhibited to us as
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:56517:139"/>a Symbol thereof. But therefore as we are to underſtand by doing what we do <hi>in remembrance of him,</hi> and of his Death, or (as the <hi>Greek</hi>

Only, as it is not to be thought, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour would have inſtituted this Sacrament ſimply to bring the thing ſignified by it to our own, or others Minds, but to ſtir up in them, and us affections ſutable to the thing remembred; So we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to think (becauſe the thing ſignified by it was Chriſt's giving his Body to Death for us, and for our Salvation) that it was deſign'd to ſtir up us, and other Men to remember his Death, and the benefits thereof with a thankful Mind, with a Mind ſenſible of ſo great a favour, and ready to expreſs that ſenſe of its by all the ways it can poſſibly deviſe. This I take to be that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,</hi> for which our Saviour requir'd his Diſciples to <hi>do,</hi> as he himſelf had before directed, and enjoyn'd them. And how well fitted that whole Ceremony is to excite ſuch a remembrance in <hi>us,</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> will appear if we conſider that remembrance either as a <hi>ſimple</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Chriſt's Death, and the Benefits thereof, or as alſo a <hi>grateful</hi> one. For it ſerves to the former of theſe by the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation it makes to our Eyes of the violence, that was offer'd to his Crucified Body, and by the known Laws, and ends of the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. And it ſerves in like manner to the latter of them by repreſenting that Death of his to our Eyes, not in bloody, and cruel Rites (as the ill uſage of ſome of the Heathen Deities were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time repreſented) but in the innocent, and uſeful, and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Elements of Bread, and Wine, and which whilſt the Partakers thereof reflect upon, they cannot but at the ſame time read in them the both uſefulneſs, and comfortableneſs, as to themſelves, of that Body, and Blood, which they were intended to repreſent, and be thereby excited to a joyful, and thankful remembrance of them both, and of the benefits, that accrue to them thereby.</p>
                     <p>An account being thus given of the <hi>Bread</hi> of this Sacrament, and of all that was ſaid, or done about it; It remains that I entreat of the <hi>other Element</hi> thereof repreſented to us by the <hi>three Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> under the name of the <hi>Cup.</hi> Whether it were that they could not otherwiſe well expreſs what they were firſt to mention, even our Saviour's taking it, and giving it to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples (becauſe <hi>liquid</hi> things cannot well be taken by our ſelves, or convey'd to others but by a Cup) or by an uſual Metonymy of the continent for the thing contained in it, ſet to denote the Wine, wherewith it was repleniſhed; This Cup (as we ſhall afterwards underſtand) being given them to drink of, and (as appears from what our Saviour ſubjoins in the cloſe of St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s, and St. <hi>Mark's</hi> account of this matter) of the <hi>Fruit of the Vine,</hi> or Wine. Now this <hi>Cup,</hi> as he had done before with the <hi>Bread,</hi> he in like

                     <p>The Cup being thus taken by our Saviour into his Hands, and held by him there till he gave it to his Diſciples, <hi>Two</hi> of the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> tell us he <hi>gave thanks</hi> over it, and (as appears by what was ſaid before in the matter of the <hi>Bread,</hi> and by St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where<note n="(g)" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.16.</note> entitling it the <hi>Cup of bleſſing, which we bleſs</hi>) by that <hi>Thankſgiving</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> bleſſed it, or rather recommended it to the Father to be bleſſed by him, and made uſeful for thoſe purpoſes, for which it was deſign'd, and particularly for the <hi>Communion</hi> of his Blood. Which Bleſſing there is no doubt the Father granted thereupon, and fitted it for that, for which it was ſo ſeparated, and recommended to him: As becauſe he readily promis'd the like, or a greater Bleſſing to the Bleſſing<note n="(h)" place="margin">Num. 6.23, &amp;c.</note> of the Jewiſh Prieſts, and may therefore be preſum'd as ready to grant this to the Bleſſing of his well beloved Son; So becauſe our Saviour, when he gave this <hi>Cup</hi> to his Diſciples, told them even then, that it was <hi>his Blood of the New Teſtament,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that being <hi>bleſſed</hi> by ſuch as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, it was the <hi>Communion</hi> of Chriſt's Blood, which it could not have been in either inſtance without the Bleſſing of the Father.</p>
                     <p>Our Saviour having thus <hi>taken,</hi> and <hi>given thanks over</hi> the Cup, or bleſſed it, gave it to his Diſciples, ſaying, <hi>Drink ye all of it.</hi> But whether (as was ſaid before in the matter of the Bread) he gave it into <hi>each</hi> of his Diſciples Hands, or to him only, that ſat next to him, and by him to be handed to the next, is not material, neither will I therefore concern my ſelf about it. Sure it is, that, by the words accompanying that Gift, he ſignified it to be his Mind, that they ſhould all drink of it, and St. <hi>Mark</hi> in particular tells us, that <hi>they all drank</hi> of it. Upon the ſtrength of what <hi>Motive,</hi> is in the next place to be enquir'd, but which we ſhall not need to go farther than St. <hi>Matthew</hi> for, or at leaſt not for the <hi>general notion</hi> of it. <hi>For this</hi> (ſaith he in our Saviour's name) is <hi>my Blood of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is ſhed for many for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> The thing, which I now offer you, is <hi>my Blood of the New Teſtament,</hi> and it is upon that account I both invite, and oblige you all to drink of it. And if it was, even when he offer'd it to them to drink, his Blood of the New Teſtament, one would think it ſhould need no new Bleſſing, or Conſecration to make it ſuch, and much leſs, that thoſe words, by which he declar'd it to be ſo, ſhould be that bleſſing, or Conſecration it ſelf. But be that as it will at preſent (for the fuller diſcuſſion of theſe things belongs to another place) moſt certain it is from the other <hi>Evangeliſts, and from St. Paul,</hi> that our Saviour when he gave the <hi>Cup</hi> to the Diſciples, made uſe of theſe, or the like words, upon what occaſion ſoever they were employed by him. And as certain it is from the Controverſies now on foot, that the words conſider'd in themſelves will require an explication, to which therefore I ſhall now addreſs my ſelf; In order thereunto (as I did before in the matter of the <hi>Bread</hi>) enquiring what the <hi>ſubject</hi> of this Propoſition is, what the thing <hi>predicated</hi> of it, and what the

                        </gap>, or Cup is not expreſs'd, and much more where <hi>This is my Blood</hi> is aſſign'd as a motive to the Diſciples drinking of the <hi>Cup</hi> (For how could it otherwiſe be any motive to it, if that Cup were not the Blood here ſpoken of?) So our Saviour's commanding his Diſciples to drink of that Cup in order to their partaking of his Blood, and his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards deſcribing it by the title of <hi>the Fruit of the Vine,</hi> ſhews the <gap reason="foreign">

Which is a proof that figurative expreſſions are no ſuch ſtrangers to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of a Sacrament, becauſe one is of neceſſity to be allow'd in the <hi>ſubject</hi> of this important Propoſition, and is accordingly allow'd by the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>ſubject</hi> of the preſent Propoſition being thus found out, and ſhewn to be no other than the <hi>Cup</hi> before ſpoken of, or rather the Wine of it; Let us in the next place take a view of the thing <hi>affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> of it, and wherein indeed there is ſome variety even between thoſe, who give an Hiſtorical account of this affair: St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and St. <hi>Mark</hi> repreſenting the <hi>Cup</hi> here ſpoken of as Chriſt's <hi>Blood of the New Teſtament,</hi> or Covenant, <hi>which was ſhed for many for the remiſſion of fins;</hi> but St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> as the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> or Covenant, <hi>in his Blood, which was ſhed for them.</hi> For which cauſe I will conſider the thing here affirmed under each of theſe notions, and firſt as Chriſt's <hi>Blood of the New Teſtament,</hi> or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which I conceive to be the cleareſt, and moſt proper decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it. Becauſe it appears even by that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who makes uſe of the other expreſſion, that the <hi>Blood</hi> of Chriſt is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal thing ſignified by it, even in that very Chapter, where he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles it the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> in his Blood. For not only doth he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note n="(i)" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.16.</note> entitle the Cup the <hi>Communion of his Blood,</hi> as he doth the Bread in the ſame verſe the <hi>Communion of his Body,</hi> but, immediately after the words of the Inſtitution, declare him, who eateth that Bread, and drinketh that <hi>Cup</hi> with due preparation, to ſhew forth the Lord's Death till he come, as
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:56517:140"/>him, who eateth, and drinketh unworthily, to be guilty of his <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Bloody.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Blood</hi> of Chriſt therefore being the thing principally ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and conſequently the principal thing predicated of the Cup, by the one, and the other, reaſon would that we ſhould enquire what our Saviour meant by it, that is to ſay, whether that Blood, which now ran in his Veins, and was ſhortly after to be ſhed, or only a memorial of it. A Queſtion, which will ſoon be voided not only by what I have before ſaid concerning the Notion of Chriſt's <hi>Body,</hi> but by the Adjuncts of that very Blood, whereof we ſpeak: The Blood of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> or Covenant (as appears by a Text of the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
                        <note n="(k)" place="margin">Heb. 9.14, &amp;c.</note>, and by what I have elſewhere<note n="(l)" place="margin">Expl. of the Sacrament in general, Part 2.</note> diſcours'd upon it) being no other than that Blood, which the Mediator of it ſhed at his Death, (For that Author tells us, that neither that, nor any other Teſtament, or Covenant can be firm without it) And the Blood, that was ſhed for remiſſion of Sins, the very ſame: It being by means of the ſame <hi>Death,</hi> that the <hi>Redemption of Sins againſt the Firſt Teſtament,</hi> or Covenant is procur'd, which is but another Name for the Remiſſion of them. And I ſhall only add, for the better explanation of thoſe words, even <hi>the Blood of the New Teſtament,</hi> or Covenant, that as of old God would not enter, nor did enter into the Firſt Covenant with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> till he was aton'd, and they ſprinkled by the Blood of their Sacrifices; So neither would he enter into the New, till he was firſt aton'd, and we ſprinkled by the Blood of the Sacrifice of his Son, and that Blood therefore, conformably to what was ſaid of the Blood of the Firſt Covenant, ſtiled the Blood of the New.</p>
                     <p>There will be no great difficulty, after what I have ſaid of <hi>the Blood of the New Teſtament,</hi> or Covenant, as to the meaning of that <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> or Covenant <hi>in</hi> Chriſt's Blood, which St. <hi>Luke</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> bring in our Saviour as affirming the <hi>Cup</hi> to be: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thereby muſt conſequently be meant that New Covenant, which was brought about <hi>by the Bloud of his Croſs,</hi> even that, by which the ſame Saint <hi>Paul</hi> elſewhere<note n="(m)" place="margin">Col. 1.20.</note> tells us, that Chriſt <hi>made Peace</hi> between us, and God. Which will conſequently leave nothing more to us to enquire into upon this Head, than the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of that <hi>[is],</hi> which joyns the <hi>ſubject,</hi> and the foregoing <hi>predicates</hi> together, and how the Cup of this Sacrament <hi>was,</hi> and <hi>is</hi> his <hi>Blood of the New Teſtament,</hi> or Covenant, and how the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> or Covenant <hi>in his Blood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the underſtanding whereof though it may ſuffice to remit my Reader to what I before ſaid upon the account of the <hi>Bread</hi>'s being Chriſt's Body; becauſe that <hi>mutatis mutandis</hi> may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to the Particle <hi>[Is]</hi> here; Yet I ſhall add <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> that there cannot well be any doubt of its being taken figuratively here, either in the one, or the other predication concerning it: Becauſe the <hi>Cup</hi> of this Sacrament cannot literally, and properly be both <hi>his Blood of the New Teſtament,</hi> or Covenant, and <hi>the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or Covenant in it, which yet in ſome, or other of the Sacred Writers it is affirm'd to be. Which, as it will make it ſo much the more reaſonable to allow of that figurative Senſe here, which we have attributed to the ſame Particle <hi>Is</hi> in <hi>This is my Body;</hi> So
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:56517:141"/>conſequently make it reaſonable to underſtand by <hi>This is my Blood of the New Teſtament,</hi> which anſwers directly to the other, This is a <hi>Sign,</hi> and a <hi>Memorial,</hi> and a <hi>Means of its conveyance,</hi> as well as the <hi>Bread</hi> is of <hi>my Body.</hi> And indeed, as the <hi>Cup,</hi> or rather the <hi>Wine</hi> of it may well paſs for a <hi>Sign</hi> of that Blood, as for other Reaſons, ſo for that effuſion, which is attributed to it; So that it is both a <hi>Memorial,</hi> and a <hi>Means of its conveyance,</hi> is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s bringing in our Saviour ſubjoining the words, <hi>Do this, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me,</hi> to the Story of the <hi>Cup,</hi> and elſewhere repreſenting the ſame <hi>Cup</hi> as the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of his Blood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This I take to be a fair account of the Particle <hi>[Is],</hi> as it is made uſe of to connect the <hi>Cup,</hi> and Chriſt's <hi>Blood of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcament,</hi> or Covenant. And it will be no leſs eaſie to give as clear an account of it, as it is made uſe of to connect the ſame <hi>Cup,</hi> and the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> or Covenant <hi>in his Blood:</hi> That <hi>Cup</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting to us <hi>God's exhibiting</hi> together with it Chriſt's <hi>Blood,</hi> and the Merits of it, and our <hi>receiving</hi> that Blood, and the Merits of it with that thankfulneſs, which doth become us, and a Mind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to walk worthy of thoſe Benefits we receive by it.</p>
                     <p>I will conclude this long Diſcourſe concerning the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of this Sacrament, when I have lightly animadverted upon that, which St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and St. <hi>Mark</hi> bring in our Saviour ſubjoining to all he had ſaid concerning the Elements thereof; To wit, that he would not any more drink of <hi>this Fruit of the Vine</hi> (for ſo St. <hi>Matthew</hi> expreſſeth it) until he ſhould drink it new with them in his Father's Kingdom. For though it ſhould be granted, what <hi>Grotius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for out of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> that theſe words were ſpoken juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Inſtitution of this Sacrament, and only plac'd here upon the account of Chriſt's being again to ſpeak of the Cup; Yet thus much muſt be granted to St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s placing it here, that it was the <hi>Fruit of the Vine,</hi> that our Saviour gave them, and they accordingly drank of, even in this Sacrament of the Lord's Supper: There being no more reaſon (nor ſo much nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, conſidering that that is the immediate Antecedent) to deny <hi>this Fruit of the Vine</hi>'s referring to what our Saviour gave his Diſciples, and they all drank of, than there would be to deny its relating to that Cup, which he took into his hands, and bleſſed. Which if we ſhould, there would be no proof either here, or elſewhere of <hi>the Fruit of the Vine</hi>'s being one of the Symbols of this Sacrament.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. That <hi>Bread,</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> are the <hi>outward part,</hi> or <hi>Sign</hi> of the Lord's Supper is ſo evident from the Story of the Inſtitution, and the account I have already given of it, that it would be but loſt labour to go about to prove it. It may ſuffice here to add, that as Bread, and Wine, were the Matter of that <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Euchariſt, which in all probability was the Pattern of the Chriſtian one; So the Practice of the Church of God hath been always conformable to it, neither have any Perſons willingly varied from it, I will not ſay that have not been branded for Hereticks, but that have not alſo been look'd upon as either ſtupidly ignorant, or blotches of the Church, rather than any part of it. Of which nature were thoſe <hi>Aquarii</hi> mention'd by St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">De haereſ. c. <hi>6.</hi> Ed. Dan.</note>, and before him written againſt by St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
                        <note n="†" place="margin">Ad Caecil. Ep. <hi>63.</hi>
                        </note>, <hi>that offer'd Water in the Cup of the Sacrament inſtead of that, which all the Church doth.</hi> Whether that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd the Creation of God, as ſeveral of the ancient Hereticks did, and accordingly abſtain'd wholly from Wine, as well as from ſome other things; Or (as I rather think for the moſt part) by way of exerciſe upon, and mortification of themſelves, of which ſort of Abſtinences out of the Sacrament there are frequent Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Antient Chriſtians: Little conſidering that Obedience is much better than ſuch Sacrifices, though they were otherwiſe of far greater worth, than they will be found upon examination to be. For if St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">1 Tim. 5.23.</note> could admoniſh <hi>Timothy,</hi> even <hi>for his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach's ſake, and his often Infirmities, not to drink any longer Water, but to uſe a little Wine;</hi> I doubt he would not have heard with any patience of his, or other Men's abſtaining wholly from the Cup of the Sacrament, or uſing Water inſtead of it out of a Principle of mortification and ſelf-denial. I do not ſay the ſame as to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part, or Sign of the Lord's Supper, <hi>where one of thoſe Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> is not to be had, or at leaſt not without much difficulty, as to be ſure in many places the <hi>Wine</hi> of the Sacrament is not. For as I find by <hi>Caſſander</hi>
                        <note n="(a)" place="margin">Liturg. <hi>c. 14.</hi>
                        </note>, that the <hi>Armenians</hi> in <hi>India,</hi> where Wine is not to be had, do beforehand ſteep dried Grapes in Water, and the next day preſs out the Juice of them for the uſe of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; So I do not ſee, but where neither the one, nor the other
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:56517:142"/>is to be had, Men may lawfully make uſe of other generous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors for the ſame purpoſe: I do not ſay only upon the account of Neceſſity, to which all poſitive Laws muſt yield, but becauſe (as I ſhall afterwards ſhew) they are equally fitted to repreſent to us thoſe things, for which the Fruit of the Vine was here ordain'd. Only let not Men make a Neceſſity where there is none, nor think themſelves excus'd in the uſe of other Liquors, where the <hi>Fruit of the Vine,</hi> though not the Product of their own Countrey, yet may well enough be had from abroad. For where our Saviour hath annex'd a Bleſſing to the uſe of ſuch, and ſuch Creatures, I do not ſee how we can expect it without, where we have not a juſt Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to excuſe it, how convenient ſoever thoſe other Creatures are, which we ſubſtitute in the room of them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But becauſe queſtion may be made, what <hi>kind</hi> of Bread, and Wine we ought to make uſe of in this Sacrament, as well as whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bread, and Wine be the ordinary Matter, or Sign of it; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall admoniſh, as to the former of theſe, that I ſee little reaſon to doubt, but that the Bread of the place we live in may ſuffice, provided it be of the better, and more nutritive ſort, or at leaſt as good as we are in a capacity to provide. For our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour having not preſcrib'd any thing as to the Grane, whereof it is to be made, and all ſorts of Bread being in their Nature ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently fitted for thoſe Sacramental Purpoſes, to which they are to be appli'd, it is a needleſs ſuperſtition to be ſollicitous about the kind of it, or indeed about any thing elſe of that nature, farther than the Laws of Decency, or the general Nature of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may ſeem to exact of us. The ſame is to be ſaid, and for the ſame reaſons as to the <hi>kind</hi> of the Wine, though the Wines of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine</hi> were generally <hi>Red</hi>

Upon which account I ſhall in this place confine my ſelf to enquire, whether it ought to be <hi>mix'd with Water,</hi> or no, as which ſeems to me to be the only material Enquiry in this Affair.</p>
                     <p>And here indeed they, who think it enough to make uſe of pure Wine, may ſeem to be hardly preſs'd, whether we do conſider the Antiquity of the contrary Uſance, or the Reaſon, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for it: For it appears from <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi>

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:56517:143"/>of Chriſt and his People,</hi> and <hi>that we can therefore in the ſanctifying of the Lord's Cup no more offer Wine alone, than we may preſume to offer Water only.</hi> Theſe things to thoſe, that have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Antiquity, cannot but appear very conſiderable, and I muſt needs ſay, they weigh ſo much with me, as to believe, that the Wine of the Sacrament might have been from the beginning dilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Water, yea that that very Wine might, which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour conſecrated into it. But this rather with reſpect to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Country, and the generouſneſs of their Wines (which might be but needful to be temper'd, where the ſame Liquor was to be the Entertainment of their Love-Feaſts, as well as the Matter of a Sacrament) than out of any regard to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament it ſelf, or that particular Myſtery in it, which St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> thought to be intended: Becauſe there is not any the leaſt hint either in the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> or St. <hi>Paul,</hi> of ſuch a mixture, or My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, but rather an intimation of Chriſt's employing only <hi>the Fruit of the Vine,</hi> and his having a regard to the ſole Properties thereof, and of that Blood of his, which he ſhed for our Redemption. If there were from the beginning any Myſtery in ſuch a mixture, it may moſt probably be thought to have been intended to make ſo much the more lively a Repreſentation to us of that Blood, which it was deſigned to remember, and which we learn from St. <hi>John</hi>
                        <note n="(f)" place="margin">Joh. 19.34.</note> to have iſſued from his ſide <hi>attended with Water,</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly particularly remarked by him. Upon which account though I cannot preſs a mixture of Wine, and Water as neceſſary, yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can I condemn it, or thoſe Churches, which upon that reaſon think fit to retain it, and enjoin on their reſpective Members the due obſervation of it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But becauſe there neither is, nor can well be a more material Enquiry, than <hi>wherein the Bread, and Wine of this Sacrament were intended as a Sign;</hi> Therefore it may not be amiſs to paſs on to the reſolution of it, and employ all requiſite diligence in it. For my more orderly performance whereof I will conſider thoſe Elements of Bread, and Wine, with reſpect to Chriſt's <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as to the <hi>uſage</hi> that Body, and Bloud of his receiv'd, when he was ſubjected to Death for us, or as to the <hi>Benefit,</hi> that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and accrued to us by them.</p>
                     <p>If we conſider the Elements of Bread and Wine with reſpect to Chriſt's Body, and Blood, as to the <hi>uſage</hi> they receiv'd, when he was ſubjected to Death for us; So we ſhall find them again to be a Sign of that Body, and Blood, by what is done to them before they come to be adminiſtred, or by the ſeparate adminiſtration of them, when they are. For in the former of theſe Notions the Bread manifeſtly became a Sign of Chriſt's Body by our Saviour's <hi>breaking</hi> of it; For which cauſe (as was before obſerv'd) St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his rehearſal of the Inſtitution, attributes that <hi>breaking</hi> to Chriſt's Body, and deſcribes its crucifixion by it. And not improbably the Wine of the Sacrament became a Sign of Chriſt's Blood by its being <hi>poured out</hi> of ſome other Veſſel into that Cup, which he took, and bleſſed, and gave to his Diſciples; There being not otherwiſe any thing in it to repreſent the <hi>ſhedding</hi> of Chriſt's Blood, which it appears by the ſeveral Evangeliſts, that our Saviour had
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:56517:143"/>a particular reſpect unto. Neither will it ſuffice to ſay (though it be true enough) that we do not read either in the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> or St. <hi>Paul,</hi> of our Saviour's before pouring the Wine of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of ſome other Veſſel into that <hi>Cup,</hi> which he made uſe of for that purpoſe, and conſequently cannot with equal aſſurance make the Wine to be a Sign of Chriſt's Blood by any ſuch effuſion of it. For whether we read of it, or no, ſuch an Effuſion muſt of neceſſity precede (the uſe of a Cup being not to keep Wine in, but to drink out of, after it hath receiv'd it by effuſion from another) and that effuſion therefore, and the particular mention there is of the effuſion of that Blood, which is acknowledg'd to be ſignified by the Wine, no unreaſonable intimation of that <hi>Effuſion</hi>'s being one of thoſe things, wherein the Wine of the Sacrament was intended as a Sign or Repreſentation of the other. By theſe means the Bread, and Wine become a Sign of Chriſt's Body, and Blood, as to what is done to them before they come to be adminiſtred. And we ſhall find them in like manner to be a Sign of the ſame Body, and Blood, by the ſeparate adminiſtration of them, when they are. For as our Saviour's Body, and Blood were parted by Death, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly requir'd to be conſider'd, the one as <hi>broken,</hi> and <hi>mortifi'd,</hi> the other as <hi>ſhed,</hi> or poured out of it; So our Saviour did not only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point divers Symbols to repreſent them, but adminiſtred them apart, and by themſelves, and (if there be any force in <hi>Do this in remembrance of me</hi>) commanded them to be ſo adminiſtred after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. By which means they become, even by that ſeparate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, a yet more perfect, and lively Repreſentation of Chriſt's Body, and Blood, <hi>as to the uſage they receiv'd,</hi> when he, whoſe they were, was ſubjected to Death for us.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe the Body, and Blood of Chriſt are conſider'd in this Sacrament <hi>as to the Benefit,</hi> that was intended, and accru'd to us by them, as well as <hi>to the uſage they receiv'd</hi> (For <hi>This is my Body, which is given,</hi> or broken <hi>for you,</hi> ſay St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>This is my Blood of the New Teſtament,</hi> or the New Teſtament in it, which is ſhed <hi>for you,</hi> ſay all the Evangeliſts upon this Argument) Therefore enquire we <hi>wherein</hi> the Elements of Bread, and Wine, are a ſign of his Body, and Blood, as to that Benefit, they were ſo intended, and given for. Which will ſoon appear if we conſider what the proper <hi>uſe</hi> of thoſe Elements is, what we are requir'd <hi>to do with them,</hi> and what is elſewhere ſaid concerning that <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> when conſider'd with reſpect to our welfare, and advantage; Theſe ſeveral things making it evident, that they become a ſign of Chriſt's Body, and Blood, by the <hi>uſe</hi> they are of to <hi>nouriſh,</hi> and <hi>refreſh us.</hi> For as we cannot lightly think, but that when our Saviour made choice of ſuch things, as thoſe, to repreſent the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of his Body, and Blood to us, he made choice of them for that purpoſe with reſpect to their proper uſefulneſs, as which is both moſt notorious in them, and moſt apt to affect the Mind of him, to whom they are ſuggeſted; So much leſs can we think otherwiſe of them, when he moreover requires us to <hi>eat</hi> of the one, and <hi>drink</hi> of the other, which are the ways by which we are to receive that nouriſhment, and refreſhment, which we have ſaid them to be ſo uſeful for. Otherwiſe any thing elſe might have
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:56517:144"/>been as proper for the purpoſe, as Bread, and Wine; Or if God, who may no doubt make uſe of what Methods he pleaſeth, thought good however to make choice of Bread, and Wine, to repreſent Chriſt's Body, and Blood, yet he might have contented himſelf to have enjoyn'd upon us the caſting our Eyes upon them, and not, as we find he doth, prompted us to <hi>eat,</hi> and <hi>drink</hi> of them, as that too in remembrance of <hi>him,</hi> and <hi>them.</hi> For what need would there be of <hi>eating,</hi> and <hi>drinking</hi> thoſe Elements in remembrance of his Body, and Blood, or indeed what aptneſs in ſo doing, to call them to our own Minds, or the Minds of others? were it not that there were ſomewhat in them to repreſent the uſefulneſs of Chriſts Body, and Blood, which was not to be drawn from them, or ſo ſenſibly perceiv'd in them, as by eating, and drinking of them. This I take to be a competent evidence of Bread, and Wine's becoming a ſign by the uſe they are of to nouriſh, and refreſh us; But I am yet more convinced of it by what is elſewhere ſaid concerning Chriſt's Body, and Blood, when conſider'd (as they are here) as to our Benefit, and advantage. Even that his <hi>Fleſh,</hi> or Body was <hi>food</hi>

For if Chriſt's Body, and Blood be in the nature of Food, and drink to us; If they be ſo far ſuch, that we are requir'd to eat, and drink of them, and ſo alſo, that we cannot promiſe our ſelves life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them: That Bread, and Wine, which in the preſent Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are appointed to ſignifie, and repreſent them, cannot be thought by any more proper way to be a Sign, or Repreſentation of them, than by their uſefulneſs as Bread, and Drink to nouriſh, and refreſh our Bodies, to maintain them in their preſent beings, and fill them with joy, and gladneſs.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The fourth thing to be enquir'd as concerning the Bread, and Wine of this Sacrament is, what evidence there is of Chriſt's <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding us to receive them.</hi> A queſtion, which one would think might ſoon be voided by the words of the Inſtitution it ſelf; <hi>Take, Eat,</hi> This is my Body being the voice of our Saviour concerning the <hi>Bread,</hi> and <hi>Drink ye all of it,</hi> and <hi>This do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me,</hi> being the words of the ſame Jeſus in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> concerning the <hi>Cup,</hi> which one would think to be ſufficient expreſſes of Chriſt's command concerning it. But as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is enough to thoſe, who are prejudic'd againſt any Doctrine, as it is apparent that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was againſt the uſe of the Cup, when this buſineſs came to be debated in the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> So that Council did not only determine, that <hi>whole, and entire Chriſt is contained under either ſpecies,</hi> and particularly <hi>under the ſpecies</hi> of <hi>Bread</hi>
                        <note n="(l)" place="margin">Seſſ. 13. cap. 3.</note>, but that <hi>the faithful are not oblig'd by any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Lord to receive both ſpecies</hi>
                        <note n="(m)" place="margin">Seſſ. 21. cap. 1.</note>, and that accordingly, <hi>if any ſhall ſay that all, and ſingular the faithful people of Chriſt are oblig'd to take both ſpecies, either by vertue of any command from God, or as of neceſſity to Salvation</hi>
                        <note n="(n)" place="margin">ib. Can. 1.</note>, <hi>he ought to be anathematiz'd for
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:56517:144"/>it,</hi> or rather hath already incurr'd it. For which cauſe it will be neceſſary for us to ſhew, that the faithful are obliged by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt to receive the Cup, and then anſwer the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal reaſons, that are brought againſt it.</p>
                     <p>And here in the firſt place I would gladly know, whether there be, or ever were any command from Chriſt for the receiving of the Cup, whether by the Apoſtles at firſt, or the Prieſt that conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates now, whatſoever become of ſimple Laymen, or the Prieſts, that do not officiate, and are therefore ſo far forth reckoned in the number of the other. The ground of which queſtion is, becauſe the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> doth not ſay, that there is <hi>no command from Chriſt</hi> for the faithful's receiving the Cup, but that <hi>the faithful are not bound by any command of his to the taking of both ſpecies;</hi> and again, that <hi>if any ſhall ſay that all the faithful ought to take both ſpecies by vertue of any command of God, let him be Anathema.</hi> For poſſibly (for ought that doth appear from the words of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil) there may have been a Command from Chriſt for all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful's receiving the Cup, but which it is in the power of the Church (as we are not ignorant of the aſſerted plenitude thereof) to caſſate, or diſpenſe with it. And poſſibly too there is no command for any either Lay, or Clergies receiving either the Cup, or the Bread, and ſo, if the Church pleaſeth, we may, and ought to bid <hi>Farewel</hi> to the Sacrament it ſelf, as well as to the Cup of it. For that I make no unreaſonable ſuppoſition here, is evident from <hi>Fiſher</hi> the <hi>Jeſuite</hi>'s<note n="(o)" place="margin">See his Anſwer in <hi>White</hi>'s Reply on Point 7. pag. 473.</note> queſtioning, whether Chriſt gave any precept at all in the matter of the Cup, and his diſtinguiſhing between precept, and inſtitution, which will avail as well againſt the Bread, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Cup. Which things being not firſt decided, it will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be to no great purpoſe to argue with them about the faithful's obligation to receive the Cup, or for them to put us upon the proof of it; Becauſe the true Queſtion may perhaps be, whether there be any Command at all for any ſort of Mens receiving the Cup, or indeed the Sacrament it ſelf in any part of it. Which if it be, both Clergy, and Laity are under the ſame Condition, and the Queſtion ought to be, Whether the whole matter of the Euchariſt were not matter of Advice even to the Apoſtles themſelves, rather than any thing of a Command. But as we cannot but think, that <hi>Take, Eat,</hi> and <hi>Drink ye all of this,</hi> are expreſs Commands to ſome Perſons, or other, becauſe they run in the ſame form with <hi>Tell it to the Church,</hi> and <hi>Obey thoſe that have the Rule over you,</hi> upon which kind of Texts all Eccleſiaſtical Authority is founded; ſo we ſhall therefore take it for granted, that the matter of the Cup is a Precept, and accordingly go on to enquire, for whom this Precept was intended, and to whom it was directed by our Saviour.</p>
                     <p>Now as if this Precept was intended for any, to be ſure it was intended for our Saviour's Diſciples, becauſe the Perſons to whom it was immediately given; So it muſt conſequently be intended for them, either in their perſonal capacity, and ſo, that it was to reach no farther than themſelves, or as they were the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of others alſo. If the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> ſay the former, they do not only alter the ſtate of the Queſtion, and make the future both Laity and Clergy in the ſame Condition as to this particular, but
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:56517:145"/>make it as indifferent too, as to any thing of a Command from Chriſt, whether the future Clergy, or Laity partake of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament at all, even in the Bread of it. Which how unreaſonable it is, may appear from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s preſſing the <hi>Corinthians</hi> with the Inſtitution of Chriſt in the matter of the Euchariſt, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly with the Precept, <hi>Take, Eat,</hi> and <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> For by that it ſhould ſeem that what was enjoin'd upon the Diſciples, at leaſt as to the Element of Bread, was enjoin'd upon them, as the Repreſentatives of others alſo. And if the Bread was ſo, why not alſo the Cup, that went along with it, and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which the words of our Saviour in S. <hi>Matthew</hi> are as expreſs, <hi>Drink ye all of this,</hi> and St. <hi>Mark</hi> tells us, that he alike gave them, and they all drank of it? And I know of nothing, that can look like the ſhadow of an Objection againſt this way of reaſoning, unleſs it be what ſome have vainly objected, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it as a Precept from Chriſt, that the Apoſtles, and after them others ſhould drink of it, but that, when they did drink of it, or <hi>as often as they did,</hi> they ſhould do it in remembrance of him, as if there were nothing abſolute concerning the Cup. But as the contrary is plain enough from St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> who brings in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour enjoining them to drink all of it, and as it happens too with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the addition of doing what they did in remembrance of him, leſt any ſhould ſatisfie themſelves with ſo vain a ſubterfuge; So there was reaſon enough for St. <hi>Paul,</hi> after his accurate rehearſal of the whole Inſtitution of the <hi>Bread,</hi> and of our Saviour's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand concerning it, to content himſelf with ſaying, <hi>Do this, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me:</hi> Partly, becauſe this form of Speech, or Command was enough to confute, and diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance that unworthy partaking of the Lord's Supper, which was ſo rife among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and for the diſcountenancing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of this account of Chriſt's Inſtitution was given; But eſpecially, becauſe that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or <hi>in like manner the Cup,</hi> wherewith St. <hi>Paul</hi> uſhers in that part of the Inſtitution, which reſpected it, did ſufficiently imply Chriſt's doing alike to, and enjoining alike concerning the Cup, as he had before affirm'd him to have done to, or concerning the Bread, ſo far as the different nature of the Elements did permit. Otherwiſe we muſt ſuppoſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> to have thought the <hi>bleſſing</hi> of the Cup as indifferent a thing, as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi> make the uſe of it to be, which yet it is evident from this <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> that he did not: He repreſenting that <hi>Bleſſing</hi> as a thing of ſo great concernment, as to give denomination to the <hi>Cup</hi>
                        <note n="(p)" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.16.</note>, and not only ſo, but intimating it to be of like uſe to make it to become the <hi>Communion</hi> of Chriſt's Blood.</p>
                     <p>The Cup therefore, or rather the Command concerning the uſe of it being manifeſtly intended for the Diſciples of Chriſt, not in their perſonal capacity only, but as they were alſo Repreſentatives of others; Enquire we in the next place, whether it was intended for them as Repreſentatives of all the faithful whatſoever, or as Repreſentatives of the Clergy only, and particularly of ſuch of them, as were to conſecrate the Bread, and it. A Queſtion, which one would think might eaſily be anſwered by conſidering that, when the Sacrament was firſt inſtituted, the Diſciples had no hand
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:56517:145"/>at all in the Conſecration of the one, or the other Element, but he, by whom it was inſtituted. For our Saviour making no uſe of their Aſſiſtance in conſecrating the Cup, or Bread, they are to be look'd upon rather as Lay-men, than Clergy-men as to any thing they were then enjoin'd; Unleſs the thing enjoin'd could be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe made appear to be proper to Clergy-men as ſuch. Even as it is apparent that the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves look upon ſuch of their own Clergy, as do not conſecrate the Euchariſt, and accordingly withhold the Cup from them, as well as from the meaneſt Lay-man. Now what is there in the receit of the Cup, that we ſhould think it to be proper to the Clergy? What in the Command of Chriſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to intimate any ſuch thing? what in the reaſon of the thing enjoin'd to perſwade it? For as there is no difference, ſo far as we can ſee, between <hi>Take, Eat</hi> the Bread, and <hi>drink ye all of</hi> the Cup, that we ſhould think one to reſpect the Clergy, any more than the other; So one would think the reaſon aſſign'd by our Saviour in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> for their drinking all of it, even becauſe <hi>it was his Blood of the New Teſtament, which was ſhed for many for the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Sins,</hi> ſhould concern the Laity, as well as the Clergy that conſecrate, and conſequently that Precept alſo, which it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to enforce. Unleſs we ſhould think, or indeed could, that the Laity, and fuch of the Clergy, as do not conſecrate, have no intereſt in Chriſt's Blood, or the Benefits thereof, or at leaſt that they were no way oblig'd with due thankfulneſs to remember it. But beſide that our Saviour's Diſciples had no intereſt in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrating that Euchariſt, which he celebrated with them, and were therefore ſo far forth to be look'd upon rather as Lay-men, than Clergy-men, and conſequently Repreſenters of thoſe, that were ſuch, where there was nothing enjoin'd upon them, that was not manifeſtly peculiar to them as Prieſts; St. <hi>Paul,</hi> where he repeats the ſame Inſtitution of Chriſt, doth not only make no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Prieſt and People as to this particular, but rather ſuppoſe the Cup to be common to all, and accordingly both warns all to beware of ſuch an unworthy receiving of it, as they had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore guilty of, and exhorts them as indifferently, after they had well examin'd themſelves, to drink of the Cup, as to eat of the Bread: Thereby farther intimating, that they were all alike con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the thing it ſelf, I mean as to the receit of it. So that, for ought that hitherto doth appear, we muſt not only look upon the receit of the Cup as a thing under Command, but under ſuch a Command too, as reſpects People, as well as Prieſt, yea as well as that very Prieſt that conſecrates <hi>it,</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> Element. Which will conſequently leave nothing more to enquire upon this head, than whether as the receit of the Cup, even by the Faithful, be a thing under Command, ſo thoſe Faithful are under the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of it, and bound by it to the receiving of the Cup.</p>
                     <p>Now though a Command, as ſuch, doth naturally oblige, and conſequently they, that are under it, are obliged by it, and to that, which is the matter of it; Yet becauſe queſtion may ſeem to have been made by the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> rather concerning Men's being bound by any Precept of Chriſt to receive the Cup, than concerning the Precept it ſelf, therefore I will ſet my ſelf more
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:56517:146"/>particularly to the reſolution thereof, and, together with that, of thoſe Objections that are made againſt it. In order thereunto aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting, firſt, that if there be ſuch a Command, as we have before evinc'd, they, for whom that Command was intended, are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally obliged by it to that, which is the matter of it: This being no more, than what the very nature of a Command enforceth, and the Credit of the Author of it perſwades. For as it is of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Command to oblige, and conſequently they, that are under it, generally obliged by it, as without which otherwiſe that Command would not have its end; So it is not for the Credit of him, that gave it, either to preſcribe that, which cannot general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be obſerved, or not to hold thoſe, that can, to the obligation of it: This opening a way to the contempt of his Authority, and not only to reject this, or that particular Command, but all. From whence as it will follow, that it muſt be only as to ſome Perſons, and ſome Caſes, that the Precept of the Cup muſt be thought not to oblige, if indeed it do not; So that alone being granted, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving of whole Towns, and Provinces, and Kingdoms of the Cup, will admit of no Excuſe, which will be enough to juſtifie us for ſeparating from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this Affair, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for uſurping ſo much upon the World againſt a Divine Inſtitution, and Command: Only to diſpenſe with a Law, as to the Major part, being rather to deſtroy, than diſpenſe with it; How much more then to hinder the Major part from the obſervance of it by contrary Decrees, and by Anathema's upon thoſe, who ſhall not acquieſce in them? But becauſe all we have hitherto ſaid tends only to ſhew, that the <hi>generality</hi> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are oblig'd to the receit of the Cup, which is an intimation, unleſs we proceed farther, that ſome Perſons, and in ſome Caſes, may be exempted from the Obligation; And becauſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends that ſhe is not without reaſons to ſhew, that there is no Obligation <hi>upon all, and ſingular the Faithful,</hi> to receive it; Therefore I will now proceed to conſider the reaſons of that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and ſhew whether, or no, and how far they ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
                     <p>And firſt it is pretended that there are ſome Countries in the World, which are not furniſhed with Wine, nor can, it may be, with any Conveniency furniſh themſelves from other places, or at all for publick, and general Communions. And I will not deny but ſuch places there may be, and that they cannot therefore (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no one can be ty'd to that which is impoſſible) be oblig'd either to celebrate, or receive the Euchariſt in it. But as this ſignifies nothing to the defence of thoſe, who forbid it where it may be had, and is therefore very frivolouſly alledged in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Caſe; So I ſhall upon the ſtrength of what I have before ſaid, refer it to Conſideration, whether ſome other generous Liquor, which I ſuppoſe few Nations want, may not be ſubſtituted in the place of Wine, and ſo the Cup be preſerved, though that ſpecifical Liquor cannot.</p>
                     <p>It is pretended, ſecondly, (which I doubt not might give the firſt occaſion to the taking of it away) that there would be great danger of irreverence otherwiſe by ſhedding the Liquor of it either
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:56517:146"/>in the Church by carrying it to the Communicants there, or in carrying of it, eſpecially over the Mountains in Winter, to ſick Perſons; By the hanging of ſome part of it in the Beards of the Laicks, whereſoever it was delivered to them, or by its growing ſowre by being kept. For to theſe, and the like Purpoſes did ſome of the Fathers of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> diſcourſe<note n="(q)" place="margin">Hiſt. of the Council of <hi>Trent li.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 521.</note>, and as it ſhould ſeem too out of <hi>Gerſon</hi> the learned Chancellor of <hi>Paris.</hi> But a Man would wonder, firſt, that if theſe were juſt Reaſons for abridging the Laity of the Cup, they ſhould not have prevail'd with our Saviour (who certainly knew all, that might hereafter happen) not to admit them to it at the firſt, but however that they ſhould not have taken him off from enjoining them to drink of it. A Man would wonder as much, ſecondly, why there ſhould be thought to be ſo great a danger of ſhedding in carrying about the Cup in the Church, when among us, who practiſe it in great Congregations, no ſuch danger doth appear, and when that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger may in a great meaſure be prevented by bringing thoſe, that are to receive, to the Rails of the Communion Table, to take it from the Prieſt there. And a Man would wonder no leſs, thirdly, why ſo much ado ſhould be made about the carrying of it to ſick Folks, and the danger that attends it, eſpecially when it is over Mountains. Becauſe if Men were prompted, as they ought, to a frequent Communion in the publick Aſſemblies, there would be the leſs need of carrying it to them, when ſick; Or, if it were thought meet however, that they ſhould receive the Communion, when ſick, it might be conſecrated, as well as adminiſtred to them at home, and a reaſonable number of Communicants provided to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive with them, as it is with us. Or, if that were not thought fit neither, but that they muſt by all means be debar'd the Cup, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the danger of the Liquors growing ſowre by being kept for them, or of its ſhedding in the carriage; yet is there no ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable reaſon why they, that are whole, and come to it, inſtead of expecting its being brought to them, ſhould be therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of it even in the Church, becauſe it may not be convenient to be brought to their Houſes, it may be, once. Theſe things, I ſay, a Man might well wonder at, but eſpecially when they are urg'd, as they are, for a total removing of the Cup. But a Man would more than wonder, fourthly, if he did not know the force of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and Cuſtom, that the hanging of the Liquor in the Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's Beards ſhould be made ſo great a difficulty, and danger, as to debar them of the uſe of it. For not to ſay that it is ſtrange that, if that were ſo conſiderable a thing, neither our Saviour ſhould be aware of it, when he inſtituted the Cup, nor the Church in ſo many Centuries of Years take care to prevent it, eſpecially when Beards were more in Faſhion, than they have been of late; A Man would think, that if the Blood of Chriſt, and the obſervation of a Command of his were a matter of as great moment, as the fear of the loſs of any of that Blood in the Lay-mens Beards; A Man would think, I ſay, that in ſuch a Caſe both the Prieſts ſhould have enjoin'd the Laity, and the Laity for that time have wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſubmitted to the ſhaving of their Beards, rather than have ſuffered themſelves, for the ſake of ſuch an excrement, to be
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:56517:147"/>robb'd of Chriſt's Blood, or go againſt his Inſtitution, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: To take away the Cup of the Sacrament for ſuch like Fears as theſe, being ſomewhat more extravagant than <hi>Lycurgus</hi> King of <hi>Thrace</hi>'s cutting down all the Vines of his Kingdom for fear of the ill uſe that might be made of the Fruit of them. In fine, a Man might wonder (if ſuch like things, as theſe, were an affront to the Holy Sacrament, and, as ſuch, of ſufficient force to remove the uſe of the Cup) why our Saviour ſhould not have found out ſome more decent place, than the Stomach of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to beſtow one Element of the Sacrament in, or than the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach of the Prieſt to beſtow them both; They, who are acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the inſide of that, knowing it in that reſpect, to be a more unſeemly place for one, or the other Element to be lodged in, than many of thoſe, which they ſeem to be ſo jealous of, and for fear of any pollution by which they deprive the Faithful of the benefit of the Cup, and of that, whether Wine, or Blood, that is contained in it.</p>
                     <p>The third thing pretended for depriving the Faithful of the Cup is, that <hi>whole, and entire Chriſt is contained under one only Species</hi>
                        <note n="(r)" place="margin">Trid. Conc. Seſſ. <hi>21.</hi> cap. <hi>3.</hi>
                        </note>. Which the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> doth ſo peremptorily affirm, that it pronounceth an <hi>Anathema</hi> upon any one that ſhall deny<note n="(s)" place="margin">ib. <hi>Can.</hi> 3.</note>, that <hi>whole, and entire Chriſt the Fountain, and Author of all Graces is receiv'd under the only Species of Bread.</hi> For, if that be true, what need is there of the receit of the Cup by them, or indeed what preſumption of Chriſt's having given any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand concerning it? But are they ſo ſure, as they would be thought to be, that whole, and entire Chriſt is contain'd under the ſole Species of Bread? Or, if it were, that it were therefore indifferent, whether we receiv'd the Cup, or no? Nay, is there not ſufficient reaſon to believe that whole, and entire Chriſt is not contained under it, but under the one, and other Species? For beſide that our Saviour, by making choice of two diſtinct Elements to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them, made as manifeſt a ſeparation between his Body, and Blood in the Sacrament, as he did upon the Croſs, and may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be preſum'd to give them (if he gave them at all in their ſenſe) not conjunctly, but apart, and in that ſeparate eſtate, in which he had put them; Beſide that he requir'd not only two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, and ſeparate Acts (thoſe of <hi>eating,</hi> and <hi>drinking</hi> I mean) but two Acts, that were diſtant in time toward the partaking of that Body, and Blood, and may therefore be yet more preſum'd to give them not conjunctly, but apart, and agreeably to thoſe Acts, which he enjoin'd for the partaking of them; If the Body, and Blood of Chriſt are contained under, and received with the ſole Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Bread (as to be fure they muſt, if whole, and entire Chriſt be) It muſt be either by vertue of thoſe words, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> This is my Body; <hi>or</hi> by vertue of thoſe words, and the words that follow, even <hi>This is my Blood of the New Teſtament</hi> (As one would think that they, who lay ſo much ſtreſs upon thoſe words, ſhould readily grant either the one, or the other) <hi>or</hi> by vertue of that <hi>natural Connexion</hi> and <hi>Concomitancy</hi> (to ſpeak the words<note n="(t)" place="margin">Seſſ. <hi>13.</hi> cap. <hi>3.</hi>

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:56517:147"/>between themſelves.</hi> If they, who maintain whole Chriſt (and conſequently his Body; and Blood) to be contained under the Species of Bread, affirm that to be by the ſole vertue of thoſe words, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> or, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> They muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently make them ſignifie, <hi>This is my Blood,</hi> as well as <hi>my Body,</hi> as without which, even in their own opinion, ſo omnipotent an Effect is not to be produc'd. Which ſuppos'd, I would fain know whether they ſignifie ſo much always, or only when the Sacrament is adminiſtred in one kind, and to thoſe alone, to whom it is ſo adminiſtred. If the words, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> ſignifie ſo always, (and the like will follow, if the Body and Blood of Chriſt be by any means brought together under the Species of Bread) then is there no neceſſity, nor ever was of any Man's receiving the Cup, whether he be Prieſt, or private Perſon, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrater of the Bread, and it, or only a ſimple Communicant. Then every one too, that heretofore did, or now doth receive in both kinds, doth in one, and the ſame Euchariſt receive the Blood twice, once in the Species of Bread, and again in the Species of Wine. In fine, by the ſame Rule, and their affirming whole Chriſt to be contained under either Species, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum</hi> may be as proper to make a Tranſubſtantiation of the Cup, as it is a Tranſubſtantiation of the Bread. The two former whereof render our Saviour's injunction concerning the receit of the Cup perfectly unneceſſary; The laſt gives us occaſion to wonder, why our Saviour (who to be ſure affected no change of Phraſe) did not make uſe of the ſame <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum</hi> to make an alteration of the Cup, eſpecially when, if he had, it might have ſo aptly hinted to us the ſufficiency of one only Species to poſſeſs us of his Body, and Blood. Theſe I take to be the natural Conſequences of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum</hi> to ſignifie at all times, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> and by vertue thereof to poſſeſs the Receivers of that, over which they are pronounc'd, of whole, and entire Chriſt. And if, on the other ſide, they with whom we have to do, make thoſe words to ſignifie ſo only, where the Sacrament is adminiſtred but in one kind, and only to thoſe, to whom it is ſo adminiſtred, they muſt conſequently make the very ſame words, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> to ſignifie one thing to the Lay-man, who receives but in one kind, and another to the Prieſt, that conſecrates, and receives in both. Which beſide that it will make the ſignification of thoſe words to be arbitrary, and according as the Prieſt ſhall intend them, will make them vary from the ſignification they had in the Inſtitution of Chriſt, which is, and ought to be the Pattern of all: Our Saviour, as he both inſtituted, and diſtributed the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in both kinds, ſo to be ſure making the words, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> to ſignifie only <hi>This is my Body</hi> apart from my Blood, as which latter he both appointed a diſtinct Element for, and (as they love to ſpeak) converted that diſtinct Element into by words equally fitted for ſuch a Converſion. I think, I ſhall not need to ſay much to ſhew the Bread of the Sacrament not to be converted into Chriſt's Body, and Blood, by the force of the words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and, <hi>This is my Blood,</hi> as if the latter extended to the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the former, as well as to its own proper Sacrament, even
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:56517:148"/>the Liquor of the Cup: Both becauſe thoſe words are not appli'd even by themſelves to the Bread, but to the Cup, and cannot therefore in reaſon be thought to have any operation upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; And becauſe our Saviour in that Euchariſt, which he conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated for his Diſciples, gave them the Bread of it to eat, before he proceeded to the Conſecration of the Cup, and before therefore it could be ſuppos'd to receive any influence from thoſe words, <hi>This is my Blood,</hi> as which were not till ſome time after, pronounced by him. One only Device remains to bring Chriſt's Blood, as well as Body under the Species of Bread, called by the Schoolmen <hi>Concomitancy,</hi> but ought rather by the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> explication of it, and indeed by the words <hi>natural connexion</hi> before us'd by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> to be termed, <hi>a real <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi> By vertue of which if Chriſt's Blood, and Body are brought together under the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Bread, Chriſt's Body in the Sacrament, even that, which the words, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> produc'd, is no more that Body, which was broken upon the Croſs, at leaſt conſider'd as ſuch (for that to be ſure was ſeparated from his Blood) but his Body entire, and perfect. And then farewell not only to the natural ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> and <hi>quod pro vobis frangitur,</hi> but to the Sacrifice of Chriſt's Body in the Euchariſt, which yet they have hitherto ſo contended for, as not to think it to be ſuch only by a Figure or Memorial of it. Such reaſon is there to believe, how confidently ſoever the contrary is affirm'd, that Chriſt's Body and Blood are not contain'd under the ſingle Species of Bread. And yet if that could be prov'd, it would not therefore follow, that it were an indifferent thing, whether we receiv'd the Cup, or no. For the deſign of the ſeveral Species, and our receit of them<note n="(u)" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.26.</note> being <hi>to ſhew</hi> forth <hi>to others the Lord's Death,</hi> as well as to poſſeſs our ſelves of his Body, and Blood; If that be not to be compaſs'd without the receit of the Cup, it will make the uſe of it to be ſo far neceſſary, what ever we may gain by the Bread alone: He ſatisfying not his Duty, who complies with one end of any thing to the neglect of another, as that too which tends apparently to the Honour of the Inſtitutor, as to be ſure the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of our Saviour's Death, and Paſſion doth. Now that the Death of our Saviour cannot be otherwiſe ſhewn forth, or at leaſt not as he himſelf repreſented it, without the receit of the Cup, as well as Bread, may appear from his own repreſenting his Death as a thing effected by the <hi>ſhedding,</hi> or pouring out of his Blood (For ſo it is in the ſeveral Evangeliſts) as well as by the <hi>breaking</hi> of his Body; Blood ſhed, or poured out of a Body being not to be repreſented in a Sacrament, but by a Species at leaſt diſtinct from the Species of that Body, nor we therefore in a capacity ſo to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or ſhew it forth by our receiving, but by the receit of ſuch a diſtinct one. Add hereunto, that as it is agreed among all Men, that the Death which we are to repreſent, or ſhew forth, hath the nature of a Sacrifice, and the Euchariſt it ſelf for that reaſon repreſented by the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> as ſuch; So it is alike certain, and agreed, that there is nothing more conſiderable in the Sacrifice of Chriſt's Death, than the ſhedding of his Blood, as to which he himſelf peculiarly attributes the Remiſſion of Sins. Which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:56517:148"/>therefore whoſoever will ſhew forth; as to that particular, by the receit of the Sacrament of it, he muſt do it by the receit of ſuch a Symbol, as may repreſent the Blood of Chriſt as ſeparated from his Body, which nothing but a Symbol diſtinct from that of the Body can, and therefore neither (becauſe there is no other here) but that Cup, whereof we ſpeak.</p>
                     <p>I may not forget to repreſent as a fourth Pretence, becauſe ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted by the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>

                     <p>That which our Catechiſm obligeth us eſpecially to conſider, is that which is ſignified on the part of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and which accordingly it declares to be that Chriſt's <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Blood.</hi> A thing, which conſider'd in the general, admits of no diſpute, becauſe the plain Aſſertion of the Scripture, as well as the Acknowledgment of all ſorts of Men, however otherwiſe divided about the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, or the preſence of that Body, and Blood in it: They all agreeing, as they muſt, that the <hi>Body</hi> of Chriſt is that, which is ſignified by <hi>one</hi> of its Signs, and the <hi>Blood</hi> of Chriſt, which is ſignified by the <hi>other.</hi> But as it is not ſo well agreed <hi>under what Notion</hi> we are to conſider that <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> nor, for ought that I have obſerv'd, much attended to, which is, it may be, the principal Cauſe of all the Controverſie in this Particular; So I ſhall therefore, for the farther clearing of the thing, or things ſignified by this Sacrament, enquire under what Notion we ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them, which (if we have a due regard to the words of the Inſtitution) will not be ſo difficult to unfold. For from thence it will appear, firſt, that we ought to conſider Chriſt's Body, and Blood here, not in the ſtate wherein they were <hi>at,</hi> or <hi>before</hi> the Inſtitution of this Sacrament, or in that more <hi>happy</hi> one, to which they are now arriv'd, but as they were at the time of our Saviour's Crucifixion; To wit, the one as <hi>given</hi> to Death, or <hi>broken,</hi> and the other as <hi>ſhed</hi> for us. Which St. <hi>Paul</hi> farther confirms, when he tells his <hi>Corinthians</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.26.</note>, that <hi>as often as they ate the Bread of</hi> this Sacrament, <hi>and drank the Cup</hi> of it, <hi>they did ſhew forth the Lord's death till he came.</hi> The conſequent whereof will be, ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (becauſe that Death of Chriſt is repreſented by the Scriptures as a Sacrifice) that we ought to look upon that Body, and Blood of Chriſt, which we have ſaid to be ſignified by this Sacrament, as offer'd unto God by him, and as ſuch to be conſider'd in it. Which they of all Men have the leaſt reaſon to refuſe, who do not only affirm<note n="†" place="margin">Conc. Trid. Seſſ. <hi>22.</hi> cap. <hi>1.</hi>
                        </note> with us, that this Sacrament was intended for a Memorial of the Sacrifice of Chriſt upon the Croſs, but that the Body, and Blood of Chriſt is even <hi>now</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note> offer'd up to God in it under the reſpective Species thereof. It is as little to be doubted, thirdly, That as we ought to conſider the Body, and Blood of Chriſt here as offer'd up to God for us, ſo we ought to conſider them as offer'd up as a propitiatory Sacrifice for the Sins of thoſe Perſons, for whom it is offer'd. Which is not only evident from the words of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, becauſe repreſenting the Cup of this Sacrament as <hi>the Blood of the New Teſtament, which is ſhed for many for the Remiſſion of Sins,</hi> but abundantly confirm'd by the ſuffrage of thoſe Men, with whom we have moſt to do in this Affair; They not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Maſs,</hi> as they are pleas'd to call this Sacrament, as one and the ſame Sacrifice with that, which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour offer'd upon the Croſs, but as a truly <hi>propitiatory</hi> one<note n="(a)" place="margin">Ib. <hi>cap.</hi> 2.</note>, and which accordingly is of force for the ſins of the quick and the dead, and tends to the remiſſion of them.</p>
                     <p>Of what uſe theſe Conſiderations are, will more fully appear, when I come to entreat of that <hi>relation,</hi> which the outward Signs
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:56517:150"/>of this Sacrament have to the inward part thereof, or the things ſignified by them. At preſent it may ſuffice briefly to note, that the Body and Blood of Chriſt conſider'd as broken, and ſhed upon the Croſs, having now no Exiſtence in the World, nor any more capable of having ſuch an Exiſtence, than that, which is paſt, can be recall'd; They cannot be ſubſtantially preſent either to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Elements, or to the Perſon that receiveth them, nor be ſubſtantially eaten, and drunken by him, that eats, and drinks the other; That they muſt therefore be preſent to the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Elements in a Figure, or Myſtery, and to the Receiver by their reſpective Vertue, and Efficacy; That being (as was before ſaid) to be conſider'd as offer'd up to God to atone his Wrath, and to procure the remiſſion of our Sins, and all other Graces, they muſt conſequently be look'd upon not as the immediate producers of thoſe Effects, which are attributed to them, but as meritorious Cauſes thereof, and diſpoſing God, who is the giver of every good and perfect Gift, to produce them; That therefore if the Body, and Blood of Chriſt ſtrengthen, and refreſh the Soul of the Receiver, as the Sacramental Signs thereof do the Body of him, that receives them, they muſt do it in the way of a meritorious Cauſe, and ſuch as diſpoſeth God to grant to the worthy Receiver of the Sacrament the pardon of his Sin, which is that, which eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially refreſheth the Soul, and Grace, whereby he may be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with might by his Spirit in the inner Man; In fine, that the Body, and Blood of Chriſt cannot otherwiſe be eaten, and drunken, than by the Mind meditating upon the Merits, and Satisfaction of that Offering, which our Saviour made of them, and relying wholly upon them for that Salvation, which it expects.</p>
                     <p>But leaving theſe things to be diſcuſs'd in a more proper place, where I ſhall alſo have an occaſion to add farther light and ſtrength to them; Let us in the next place reflect upon that, which I have ſaid to be ſignified on <hi>our part</hi> by the Signs of the Lord's Supper, which are theſe three eſpecially: Firſt, a <hi>thankful Remembrance of the Body, and Blood of Chriſt</hi> conſider'd as before deſcrib'd; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, our <hi>Communion with thoſe,</hi> who partake with us thereof; Thirdly, a <hi>Reſolution to live, and act,</hi> as becomes thoſe that are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of them.</p>
                     <p>Of the firſt of theſe, little need to be ſaid after the account I have given of it in my Explication<note n="(b)" place="margin">Part 3.</note> of the words of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. It may ſuffice here to obſerve from thence, that as the words of our Saviour are expreſs, that we ſhould do what is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd as to the outward Elements of this Sacrament, for a thankful Remembrance of the offering up of his Body, and Blood; So what is done by the Prieſt to thoſe Elements, and our receiving them from him in that ſtate, is a lively Repreſentation to our Minds of the offering up of Chriſt's Body, and Blood, and a thankful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance thereof therefore not unreaſonably look'd upon as one of thoſe things, which are ſignifi'd on our part by the Sacrament thereof.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond thing ſignified on our part by the outward Elements of this Sacrament is our Communion with thoſe, who partake with us of Chriſt's Body, and Blood. A thing which St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <pb n="216" facs="tcp:56517:151"/>doth not only fairly intimate, where he affirms<note n="(c)" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.17.</note>, that <hi>we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many are one Bread, and one Body, becauſe we all partake of</hi> that <hi>one Bread,</hi> which he had before affirm'd to be the <hi>Communion of Chriſt's Body;</hi> But points us to thoſe things, by which this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of ours is ſignified, even the unity of that Bread, which is one of the Elements of this Sacrament, and our partaking toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of it. For as there can be no better account given of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s calling us <hi>one Bread,</hi> and <hi>one Body,</hi> than that we our ſelves, though many, are yet one myſtical Body, as that Bread though made up of ſeveral Granes, is one Loaf, and ought accordingly to be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by admoniſh'd of that intimate Communion, which ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us in all Offices of Chriſtian Love, and Friendſhip; So there is nothing more uſual with the Antients, than to repreſent that Unity of the Bread, and Wine in the Sacrament as a Symbol of ours, and of that Communion, and Fellowſhip which ought therefore to be between us.

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:56517:151"/>perſwaded of this Communion's being a thing ſignified by this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, that (as I have elſewhere<note n="(e)" place="margin">Expl. of the Creed. Art. <hi>The holy Catholick Church.</hi>

                     <p>The third thing ſignified, on our part, by the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper is a Reſolution to live, and act as becomes thoſe, that are partakers of Chriſt's Body, and Blood.

And though it be true, that this part of the ſignification of the Lord's Supper is not ſo clearly expreſs'd in the Stories of the Inſtitution of it; Yet as they give us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that we ought to take the Elements thereof in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Chriſts giving his Body, and Blood for us, ſo they do conſequently imply our taking them alſo with a Reſolution to live, and act as becomes thoſe, that are partakers of them: That Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, as it can be no other than a thankful one, becauſe the remembrance of ſuch Benefits, as do above all others require ſuch a Remembrance of us, ſo connoting, as ſuch, a readineſs to walk well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing unto him, by whom thoſe Benefits are beſtow'd.

                     <p>Now as our Church hath defin'd a Sacrament to be ſuch <hi>an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and viſible Sign of an inward, and Spiritual Grace, as</hi> is alſo <hi>ordain'd as a means whereby we receive the ſame,</hi> and muſt therefore be ſuppos'd to have the ſame opinion of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper; So it hath ſaid enough both in its <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> and elſewhere concerning that Sacrament, to ſhew this to have been its opinion of it. For it gives us to underſtand<note n="*" place="margin">Catechiſm.</note>, that the <hi>Faithful</hi> (for whom, to be ſure, this Sacrament was principally ordain'd) <hi>do verily, and indeed receive</hi> the thing ſignified, even <hi>the Body, and Blood of Chriſt,</hi> as well as the Signs of them, and that they do verily and indeed receive that Body and Blood <hi>in the Lord's Supper,</hi> which, one would think, were a competent Evidence of that's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Means, whereby we receive them. It, conſequently thereto, teacheth us to pray<note n="†" place="margin">Pray. of Conſ. in the Commun. Service.</note>, which one would think to be of equal force as to this Particular, that <hi>we receiving God's Creatures of Bread and Wine according to his Son, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt's holy Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, may be partakers of his moſt bleſſed Body and Blood.</hi> In fine, it gives us to underſtand<note n="*" place="margin">Art. of Rel. 28.</note>, (which is yet more expreſs) that to ſuch as <hi>rightly, worthily, and with a true Faith receive the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, the Bread, which we break, is the partaking of the Body of Chriſt, and likewiſe the Cup of Bleſſing, a partaking of the Blood of Chriſt.</hi> For what more could have been ſaid (unleſs it had made uſe of that particular Expreſſion, which yet it doth uſe where it declares the general nature of a Sacrament) what more, I ſay, could have been ſaid to ſhew, that this Sacrament is no <hi>naked,</hi> or <hi>ineffectual Sign</hi> of the Body, and Blood of Chriſt, but ſuch a Sign as is alſo ordained as a <hi>Means,</hi> whereby we receive the ſame, and ſo ſure, and certain a one, that, if we rightly, and worthily receive that Sign, we do as verily receive the Body and Blood of Chriſt, as we do the Sacrament thereof.</p>
                     <p>How well the Scripture agrees with the Doctrine of our Church in this Particular, will not be difficult to ſhew, whether we do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider its making uſe of the moſt emphatical Phraſe which our Church doth concerning this Sacrament, or the Effects, which it attributeth to it. For it is St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.16.</note>, as well as our Church, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that <hi>the Bread, which we break, is the Communion of the Body of Chriſt,</hi> and that <hi>the Cup, which we bleſs, is the Communion of his
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:56517:153"/>Blood.</hi> Words, which conſidering the place they have in that Chapter from whence they are borrowed, cannot admit of a lower ſenſe, than that the elements of this Sacrament are at leaſt a Means of that Communion, becauſe alledged by him as a proof, or at leaſt as an illuſtration of their really having fellowſhip with Devils, that partook of the Sacrifices, that were offer'd to them. For if the Bread, and Wine of the Sacrament were not a Means, as well as a ſign of the Communion of the Body, and Blood of Chriſt; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could the Gentiles Sacrifices be a Means of their, or other Men's Communion with thoſe Devils, to whom they were offer'd, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither charge them with any real fellowſhip with Devils, but only with a ſign, or ſemblance of it. Which how it agrees with St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s charging the partakers of thoſe Sacrifices with having fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with Devils, as that too upon the account of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles Sacrificing to Devils, and not to God, I ſhall leave all ſober Men to judge. Such evidence there is from that one place of St. <hi>Paul</hi> concerning the Lords Supper being a Means, as well as a Sign, whereby we come to partake of the Body, and Blood of Chriſt. And we ſhall find it no leſs confirm'd by an effect, which the Scripture attributes to one of its Symbols, and which is in that place by an uſual <hi>Synecdoche</hi> ſet to denote the whole Sacrament; That, I mean, where St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms<note n="(b)" place="margin">1 Cor. 12.13.</note>, that we <hi>have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</hi> For as the foregoing mention of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> makes it reaſonable to believe, that theſe words ought to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the Cup, or Wine of the Lord's Supper; So we cannot without great violence to the words, underſtand leſs by <hi>being made to drink into one Spirit,</hi> than our partaking, by Means of that Cup, of the Blood of Chriſt, and the Benefits thereof, of which the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God is, no doubt, one of the principal ones: To be made <hi>to drink into</hi> that Blood, or the Spirit of God importing ſomewhat more, even in common underſtanding, than to receive a naked ſign of them. And though I know that ſome of the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches, and particularly thoſe of <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> and <hi>Oecolampadius</hi>'s inſtitution have been charg'd with meaner thoughts concerning the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper; Yet whoſoever ſhall take the pains to peruſe what our <hi>Coſins</hi>
                        <note n="(c)" place="margin">Hiſt. Tranſubſtant. Papal. cap. 2.</note> hath collected upon this Argument, and particularly what he quotes from <hi>Bucer</hi>
                        <note n="(d)" place="margin">ibid.</note>, will find that they always thought, or at leaſt now do, that Chriſt's <hi>true Body, and Blood are truly exhibited, given, and taken, together with the viſible ſigns of Bread, and Wine,</hi> as well as ſignified by them.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe the queſtion is not ſo much at preſent concerning this Sacrament's being a Means, whereby we receive the Body, and Blood of Chriſt, as what kind of Means it is, how it conveys to us the Body, and Blood of Chriſt, and how we receive them by it; Therefore enquire we, ſo far as we may, what our Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers in theſe particulars, and what evidence there is from the Scripture of our Churches Orthodoxy therein.</p>
                     <p>Now though we may not perhaps find in any Monument of our Church a diſtinct, and particular Anſwer to the queſtions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore propos'd; Yet we may find that in the <hi>eight</hi> and <hi>twentieth Article</hi> of our Church, which may ſerve for a general Anſwer to
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:56517:154"/>them all, and for a particular anſwer too to the laſt of them: The Doctrine thereof being, that <hi>the Body of Chriſt</hi> (and the ſame, <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> muſt be ſaid of his Blood) <hi>is given, taken, and eaten in the Supper after an heavenly, and ſpiritual manner only;</hi> and again, <hi>that the mean whereby the Body of Chriſt is receiv'd, and taken in the Supper, is Faith.</hi> For if the Body, and Blood of Chriſt be given, taken, and eaten, or drunken in the Supper after a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, and ſpiritual manner only, that Supper muſt ſo far forth be a means purely heavenly, and Spiritual, the conveyance thereof of the ſame heavenly and ſpiritual nature, and the reception of it alſo. And if, again, the Mean, whereby the Body, and Blood of Chriſt are receiv'd, and taken in the Supper, is Faith, then do we in the opinion of our Church receive them by Faith, which will ſerve for a particular anſwer to the laſt of the queſtions propos'd. To all which if we add our Churches teaching us to pray to God, even in the prayer of Conſecration, <hi>that we receiving the Creatures of Bread, and Wine according to our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt's Holy Inſtitution, may be partakers of his moſt bleſſed Body, and Blood,</hi> ſo we ſhall be able to make out a more particular anſwer to the queſtions propos'd, and ſuch as we ſhall find reaſon enough to allow.</p>
                     <p>For it appears from the premiſſes, and particularly from the prayer of Conſecration, that the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper is ſuch a ſpiritual Mean, as depends, for the force of it, not upon any vertue that is infus'd into it, and much leſs upon any natural union there is between that, and the Body, and Blood of Chriſt, but upon our receiving it, on the one hand, according to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Holy Inſtitution, and God's beſtowing, on the other hand, Chriſt's Body and Blood, upon ſuch a reception of it. It appears therefore that the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper cannot any other way convey Chriſt's Body, and Blood to us, than by prompting us, by the repreſentation it makes to us of the offering of that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and Blood upon the Croſs for us, to meditate upon it, and rely upon it for our Salvation, and by prompting God, who hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd that Body, and Blood to the due uſe of the Sacrament, to confer that Body, and Blood upon us. In fine, it appears from the premiſſes, and from a paſſage, or two<note n="(e)" place="margin">For as the benefit is great, if with a true penitent heart, and lively faith we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that Holy Sacrament, for then we ſpiritually eat the Fleſh of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And above all things ye muſt give moſt humble, and hearty thanks to God the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the Redemption of the World by the death and paſſion of our Saviour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> in our Church's exhortation to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, that we receive the Body, and Blood of Chriſt in the Sacrament, when we are thereby prompted to reflect with a penitent, and thankful heart upon the offering Chriſt made of that Body, and Blood of his upon the Croſs for us, and to rely upon it for our Salvation. Which ſeveral aſſertions what foundation they have in the Scripture, is in the next place to be enquir'd, and the Doctrine of our Church therein eſtabliſhed by it.</p>
                     <p>In order whereunto we are to know, that the Body, and Blood of Chriſt in the Lord's Supper, as well as out of it, are in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Scripture not corporal, but ſpiritual food, and as ſuch therefore to be look'd upon, and owned by us. For St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirming of the Antient Jews, that they receiv'd in their Euchariſt of <hi>Manna,</hi> and Water of the Rock, the <hi>ſame ſpiritual Meat</hi>
                        <note n="(f)" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.3, 4.</note>, and

                        <hi>drink,</hi> which we alſo do, and which he afterwards<note n="(g)" place="margin">1 Cor. 4.</note> declares to be <hi>Chriſt,</hi> muſt conſequently ſuppoſe what there is of Chriſt in our Euchariſt to be of the ſame ſpiritual nature, and becauſe the Body and Blood of Chriſt is that, which we receive by it, that that alſo is Spiritual Meat and Drink, and as ſuch to be look'd upon, and owned by us. Now as if the Body, and Blood of Chriſt in the Euchariſt are Spiritual Meat, and Spiritual Drink, they muſt conſequently be communicated rather to the Soul, than to the Body, as which alone is qualified to taſte of them, and be nouriſhed by them; So they muſt be communicated to the Soul by ſuch ways, and means, as are proper to poſſeſs the Soul of them, and receiv'd by the ſame Soul by ſuch act, or acts thereof, as are proper to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them. Which things being granted, it will not be difficult to make anſwer, what kind of Mean the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper is, how it conveys to us the Body, and Blood of Chriſt, and how we receive them by it. For if the things, which this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment profeſſeth to convey, be Spiritual Meat and Drink, ſuch as are proper for the nouriſhment of the Soul, and accordingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to it; Then muſt this Sacrament, ſo far forth, be a Spiritual Mean alſo, as which alone can make way for ſuch Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual nouriſhment to enter into the Soul. If again the things, which this Sacrament conveys, muſt be conveyed to the Soul by ſuch ways, as are proper to poſſeſs the Soul of them; Then muſt this Sacrament convey them to it, either by prompting the Soul to reflect, as the Inſtitution requires, upon that Body, and Blood of Chriſt, which it was intended to repreſent, or by prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, who hath annex'd that Body, and Blood to the due uſe of it, to confer that Body, and Blood upon us: Theſe being the only ways by which that Spiritual repaſt can be communicated to that Soul, for which it was intended. In like manner, if the things, which this Sacrament conveys, are to be receiv'd by ſuch Act or Acts of the Soul, as are proper to apprehend them; Then, if the Soul do receive the Body, and Blood of Chriſt by means of the Sacrament, it muſt do it by taking occaſion from that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to reflect, as the Inſtitution requires, upon that Body, and Blood of Chriſt, which it was deſigned to repreſent, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly with Faith in that Body, and Blood, as which is of all other things moſt required to apply them to us. And though it be true, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath found out another ſort of food, and another ſort of receiving it, as ſhall be more fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd, when I come to the handling of it; Yet as the <hi>Triden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Fathers have been forced to confeſs, that our Saviour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd this Sacrament to be taken<note n="(h)" place="margin">Seſſ. 13. cap. 2.</note> as the <hi>ſpiritual food of Souls, by which they are nouriſhed, and ſtrengthened;</hi> So they have in like manner acknowledg'd, that it ought to be <hi>ſpiritually</hi> taken<note n="(i)" place="margin">ib. cap. 8.</note>, as well as <hi>Sacramentally,</hi> in order to our profiting by it.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. Now as Strength and Refreſhment are things, which relate rather to the Body, than the Soul, and muſt therefore receive their Explication from thence; So the former, when applied to the Body, ſignifies an ability for thoſe operations, for which it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, as the latter a freedom from all heavineſs, and lumpiſhneſs. And they are brought about eſpecially by the Food, which we receive, and particularly by that Food, which was made choice of for the preſent Sacrament; <hi>Bread,</hi> as the Scripture ſpeaks<note n="(k)" place="margin">Pſal. 104.15.</note>, being that, which <hi>ſtrengthens</hi> the Heart, and <hi>Wine</hi> that, which <hi>chears</hi>

By Analogy to which, as the ſtrength, and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Soul muſt ſignifie in like manner an ability for its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per operations, and particularly for ſuch as Chriſtianity obligeth it to, and a freedom from all trouble, and diſquiet; So that, which is ſaid to ſtrengthen, and refreſh it, muſt conſequently furniſh it with ſuch an ability, and freedom, and both enable it to do thoſe things, which God requireth of it, and deliver it from thoſe troubles, and diſquiets, which its own guilt, or any thing elſe might be apt to fill it with.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This therefore being that ſtrengthening, and refreſhing of the Soul, which it is ſaid to receive by the Body, and Blood of Chriſt; Enquire we in the next place what Evidence there is of their being intended for it. Which will ſoon appear from their being intended by Chriſt as the Meat, and Drink of the Soul, and particularly as ſuch Meat, and Drink, as Bread, and Wine are to the Body. For Meat, and Drink being intended for the ſtrengthening, and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Men's Bodies, and particularly ſuch Meat, and Drink, as are the outward part of the preſent Sacrament; If the Body, and Blood of Chriſt were intended as ſuch to the Soul, they muſt be conſequently intended for its ſtrengthening, and refreſhing. Now that the Body, and Blood of Chriſt were intended as Meat, and Drink to the Soul, and particularly as ſuch Meat, and Drink, as Bread, and Wine are to the Body, is evident for the former of theſe from ſeveral paſſages of the ſixth of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel<note n="*" place="margin">See Part 3.</note>, where it is ſo declar'd in expreſs terms; and for the latter from our Saviour's making uſe of Bread, and Wine to repreſent them, and (which is more) calling upon us to eat, and drink of them in remembrance of Chriſt's giving that Body, and Blood of his <hi>for us:</hi> This, as it farther ſhews them to have been intended as our Spiritual Meat, and Drink, ſo to have been intended too in a Spiritual manner to be eaten, and drunken by us, and ſo made yet more ſubſervient to our ſtrengthening and refreſhment.</p>

Now this the Body, and Blood of Chriſt effect firſt, and chiefly, as the meritorious cauſe of that Grace, by which that ſtrengthening, and refreſhing is immediately produc'd; Or ſecondly, as ſtirring up the Minds of the Faithful to contemplate the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſneſs thereof, and, in the ſtrength of that, to grapple with all Difficulties, and bear up under all Troubles, and Diſquiets. For beſide that the Body, and Blood of Chriſt, as was before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd<note n="(m)" place="margin">Part 5.</note>, are to be conſider'd in this Sacrament under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a propitiatory Sacrifice, and which, as ſuch, doth rather diſpoſe God to grant us that ſtrength and refreſhment, which we deſire, than actually collate them on us; There is nothing more evident from the Scriptures, than that it is the Spirit of God<note n="(n)" place="margin">Eph. 3.15.</note>, and his Graces, by which we muſt be immediately <hi>ſtrengthened with might in the inner Man,</hi> and that it is by him<note n="(o)" place="margin">Acts 9.31.</note>, that we receive <hi>comfort,</hi> and <hi>conſolation.</hi> For which cauſe our Saviour gives him the title of the <hi>Comforter,</hi> and profeſſeth to ſend him to ſupply his own place in that, as well as in other particulars. From whence as it will follow, that it is to the Spirit of God, and his Graces, that we are immediately to aſcribe that ſtrength, and refreſhment, which we expect; So that we ought therefore to look upon Chriſt's Body, and Blood as conferring to it, not ſo much by any imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate influence thereof upon the Soul, as by their diſpoſing God to grant that Spirit, by which both the one, and the other are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd. Upon which account we find St. <hi>Paul,</hi> where he attributes the ſeveral Graces of a Chriſtian to the immediate Influences of that Spirit, affirming thoſe, that partake of this Cup, to be <hi>made to drink into the</hi> ſame <hi>Spirit,</hi> as that which is the immediate Author of them. This I take to be in an eſpecial manner that ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and refreſhing, which our <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> and the Scripture prompts us to aſcribe to the Body, and Blood of Chriſt; Neither can I think of any other, than what the contemplation of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritoriouſneſs thereof may infuſe into the Soul of him, who ſeriouſly reflects upon it: That, I mean, whereby the Soul becomes ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of the Divine Aſſiſtance, and Favour, as neither to doubt of his enabling it to do what he requires, nor deſpair of his deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it from all its fears, and troubles.</p>
                     <p>I will cloſe this Diſcourſe, when I have added, that as the Sign of this Sacrament hath the relation of a <hi>Means,</hi> whereby God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys, and we receive the Body, and Blood of Chriſt; So it hath alſo the Relation of a <hi>Pledge</hi> to aſſure us thereof, or, as our Church elſewhere expreſſeth it<note n="(p)" place="margin">Art. 19.</note>, <hi>a certain ſure Witneſs of it.</hi> A Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is not more generally acknowledg'd, than eaſie to make out from the former one. For what is ordained by Chriſt as a Mean for the conveying of his Body, and Blood, being as ſure to have its effect, if it be received, as it ought to be; He, who ſo receives what Chriſt hath thus ordain'd, will need no other Proof, than that, of his receiving that Body, and Blood of Chriſt, which it was ſo ordained to convey.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <head>The Contents.</head>
                        <p>The Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation briefly deduc'd from the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and digeſted into four capital Aſſertions. Whereof the <hi>firſt</hi> is, that the whole ſubſtance of the Bread is chang'd into the ſubſtance of Chriſt's Body, and the whole ſubſtance of the Wine into the ſubſtance of his Blood. The grounds of this Aſſertion examin'd both as to the poſſibility, and actual being of ſuch a change. What is alledg'd for the <hi>former</hi> of theſe from the ſubſtantial changes mention'd in the Scripture of no force in this particular, becauſe there is no appearance of the actual exiſting of thoſe things, into which the change was made at the inſtant the other were chang'd into them. As little force ſhewn to be in the words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and, <hi>This is my Blood,</hi> to prove the actual change of the Sacramental Elements, whether we conſider the word <hi>This</hi> in the former words as denoting the Bread, and Wine, or <hi>The thing I now give you.</hi> That ſuppoſed change farther impugned by ſuch Scriptures, as repreſent the Bread of the Euchariſt as remaining after Conſecration, by the concurrent Teſtimony of Senſe, and the Doctrine of the Antient Fathers. Enquiry next made into that Aſſertion, which imports, that the ſubſtances of the Sacramental Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſo chang'd, as to retain nothing of what they were before, ſave only the Species thereof. Where is ſhewn, that if nothing of their reſpective Subſtances remain, there muſt be an annihilation, rather than a change, and that there is as little ground for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining of the Species without them, either from the nature of thoſe Species, the words of Conſecration, or the Teſtimony of Senſe. That the true Body, and true Blood of Chriſt, together with his Soul, and Divinity, are under the Species of the Sacramental Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, a <hi>third</hi> Capital Aſſertion in this Matter, but hath as little ground in the words of Conſecration, as either of the former. Firſt, becauſe thoſe words relate not to Chriſt's glorified Body, and Blood, which are the things affirmed to be contain'd under the Species of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:56517:158"/>the Sacramental Elements, but to Chriſt's Body, as broken, and to his Blood as ſhed at his Crucifixion. Secondly, becauſe however they may import the being of that Body, and Blood in the Euchariſt, yet they ſpecifie nothing as to the <hi>modus</hi> of it, and much leſs inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate any thing concerning their being under the Species thereof. That that Body, and Blood (which is the <hi>fourth</hi> Capital Aſſertion in this Matter) are truly, really, and ſubſtantially under the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Species, ſhewn to be as groundleſs; and Evidence made of the contrary by ſuch Arguments from Senſe, and Reaſon, as are moreover confirmed to us by the Authority of Revelation. Some brief Reflections in the cloſe upon the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of Chriſt in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and more large ones upon what the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> advance concerning the <hi>real eating</hi> of him in it. Where is ſhewn that that, which they call a real eating, is a very improper one, that it is however of no neceſſity, or uſe toward our ſpiritual nouriſhment by him, and not only no way confirm'd by the diſcourſe of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in the ſixth of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, but abundantly confuted by it.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>UT becauſe whatever Sacramental Relations our Church may content it ſelf with, yet it is certain, that that, which calls it ſelf <hi>Catholick,</hi> hath advanc'd one of a far different nature, and thoſe of <hi>Luther</hi>'s Inſtitution another, before I paſs any farther, I will examine both the one, and the other, the grounds upon which they are built, and the ſuppoſed Reaſonableneſs thereof.</p>

                           <item>1. That the whole ſubſtance of the Bread is changed into the ſubſtance of Chriſt's Body, and the whole ſubſtance of the Wine into the ſubſtance of his Blood.</item>

                           <item>4. That they are truly, really, and ſubſtantially contain'd in, or under them. Which four Aſſertions I will conſider in their order, and after I have examin'd the grounds upon which they ſtand, oppoſe proper Arguments to them.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. That, which is firſt to be conſider'd, is, that <hi>the whole ſubſtance of the Bread is chang'd into the ſubſtance of Chriſt's Body, and the whole ſubſtance of the Wine into the ſubſtance of his Blood.</hi> An Aſſertion, which though it require as ſubſtantial a Proof, yet hath nothing of moment to ſupport it, whether as to the <hi>Poſſibility,</hi> or <hi>actual Exiſtence</hi> of it. For though the Scriptures of the <hi>Old,</hi> and <hi>New</hi> Teſtament make mention of ſubſtantial changes, and from which therefore we may infer a Poſſibility of the like (For thus we read of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s <hi>Rod</hi> being changed by the Divine Power<note n="(c)" place="margin">Exod. 4.3.</note> into a <hi>Serpent,</hi> and from a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi> again<note n="(d)" place="margin">Exod. 4.4.</note> into a <hi>Rod,</hi> of <hi>Lot's Wife</hi> being turn'd<note n="(e)" place="margin">Gen. 19.26.</note> into a <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of Salt,</hi> and of <hi>Water</hi>

If there be any change of that Nature to make out the Poſſibility of this, it muſt be that, which is made of the Nouriſhment we receive, into the ſubſtance of our Body, and Blood. But beſide that this is a change by augmentation, and muſt conſequently be either preceded by an impairing of Chriſt's glorious Body, which is not ſo conſiſtent with that eſtate, or make it in time grow into a monſtrous one; It is a change, which will not do the Buſineſs of Tranſubſtantiation, even to bring <hi>whole, and entire Chriſt</hi>
                        <note n="(g)" place="margin">Conc. Trid. Seſſ. <hi>13. cap. 3.</hi>
                        </note> under either Species: A change by augmentation being a change of the Object of it, not into the whole ſubſtance of that, into which it is chang'd, but only into a part of it.</p>
                     <p>But it may be, there is better proof of the <hi>actual being</hi> of the change we ſpeak of, than there is in any thing elſe of the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity thereof; As indeed ſuch a ſtupendous change, as this, ought to be without Example. Be it ſo; But let us at leaſt ſee ſo clear, and expreſs a Proof, that our Faith may acquieſce in it, if our Reaſon cannot; let us ſee it affirm'd by him, to whom ſo great a change is aſcrib'd. And neither are we without one, if the words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and, <hi>This is my Blood,</hi> may paſs for ſuch a Proof, as they have been hitherto repreſented to us. I will not now ſay, becauſe I have elſewhere ſhewn it<note n="(h)" place="margin">Parts 3-8.</note>, that there is much more reaſon to believe, that they ought to be figuratively taken, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not therefore be any ground for ſuch a change, as is ſought to be eſtabliſhed by them. I ſhall chooſe rather for once to allow, that they may be literally taken, and leave it to thoſe, that can, to inferr ſuch a change from them. For whether by the word <hi>This,</hi> in <hi>This is my Body,</hi> be meant the <hi>Bread</hi> before ſpoken of (As indeed how the change of the ſubſtance of the Bread into the ſubſtance of Chriſt's Body can be proved from thoſe words, which profeſs not to ſpeak of that Bread, is as hard to conceive as Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:56517:159"/>it ſelf) But whether, I ſay, be thereby meant the <hi>Bread</hi> before ſpoken of, or <hi>The thing, which I now give you,</hi> there is no appearance in the propoſition of any ſubſtantial change, and much leſs of ſuch a ſubſtantial change, as is intended to be inferred from them. All that the words profeſs to ſay (ſuppoſing them to mean <hi>Bread</hi> by the Particle <hi>This</hi>) is, that one thing is the other, but in what manner, or by what kind of change, they do not in the leaſt pretend to affirm. And if the Text do not determine either, where is that clear, and expreſs proof of ſuch a ſubſtantial change, as they profeſs to ſpeak of? Or where our either ſtupidity, or infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity for not being convinced by it? But it will be ſaid, it may be, that (literally ſpeaking) one thing cannot be another, unleſs it be ſubſtantially changed into that, which it is ſaid to be, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the Bread be Chriſt's Body, it muſt be ſubſtantially chang'd into it. To which I anſwer, that they, who ſay that (lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſpeaking) one thing cannot be another, unleſs it be ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially chang'd into that, which it is ſaid to be, do either mean, that it cannot be ſo <hi>ſtanding the ordinary Laws of Nature,</hi> or that it cannot be ſo, even by the extraordinary Power of God. If the former of theſe be their meaning, they ſay nothing, that can be of force to perſwade, that one thing can be another, even by being ſubſtantially chang'd into that, which it is ſaid to be; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, <hi>ſtanding the ordinary Laws of Nature,</hi> at the ſame time any thing is ſubſtantially chang'd into another, it is no more that, which it ſometime was, and cannot therefore in propriety of ſpeech, be ſaid to be that, which it is ſubſtantially chang'd into. On the other ſide, if they, who ſay that, literally ſpeaking, one thing cannot be another, unleſs it be ſubſtantially chang'd into that, which it is ſaid to be, mean thereby that it cannot be ſo, even <hi>by the extraordinary Power</hi> of God; They do not only take away from themſelves the power of preſſing upon our Belief, the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of Chriſt's corporal Preſence in the Sacrament upon the ſcore of God's extraordinary Power (For it ſhould ſeem by that, that there are things, to which even an extraordinary Power can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach) but leave us at liberty, where the like impoſſibilities occurr, to order our Interpretations of Scripture accordingly, and conſequently, if the literal ſenſe of a Text lead to them, to abdicate that, and impoſe upon it a figurative one. Which if we do, we ſhall find a neceſſity of putting a figurative ſenſe upon thoſe very words, which are the ſubject of the preſent Conſideration. For how is it more impoſſible for God to make Bread, continuing Bread, to be Chriſt's Body, than it is to make that Body, continuing a Body, to be circumſcrib'd, and not circumſcrib'd, as it muſt be, if it be whole, and entire in this, or that particular Sacrament, and yet at the ſame time be in ten thouſand others, and as many more, as they ſhall be pleas'd to conſecrate. So little reaſon is there to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that if by the word <hi>This</hi> in <hi>This is my Body</hi> be meant the <hi>Bread</hi> of the Sacrament, any ſubſtantial change of it can be inferred from them. And there is as little reaſon to believe it, if by the word <hi>This,</hi> in This is my Body, be meant <hi>the Thing which I now give you.</hi> For either our Saviour meant the <hi>Bread</hi> by it, and then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer exceptions will recurr, or there are no footſteps in the words
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:56517:159"/>of any change whatſoever, and much leſs of that ſubſtantial change, which is endeavour'd to be inferred from them.</p>
                     <p>But beſide that the change, we ſpeak of, hath no ground in the former words, though they ſhould be literally underſtood; There is enough to oppoſe againſt it from other places of Scripture, and particularly from thoſe, which repreſent the Bread of the Euchariſt, as remaining after Conſecration: Such as they are, that mention it as <hi>eaten</hi> by the Communicants<note n="(i)" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.26, 27, 28.</note>, and as the <hi>Communion</hi>
                        <note n="(k)" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.16.</note> of that Body, which it was intended as a Symbol of. For how is that <hi>eaten</hi> in the Sacrament, which hath not now any exiſtence? or how the <hi>Communion of Chriſt's Body,</hi> which hath no being of its own? But it may be, for all St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s naming it <hi>Bread,</hi> he meant nothing ſuch, but either the Body of Chriſt under the ſpecies of Bread, or only thoſe ſpecies themſelves. I will not now ſay, though I might, that the Scripture will be a very uncertain thing, if ſuch forc'd interpretations as theſe be eaſily admitted. But I ſay, that neither of theſe interpretations alone will fit the texts we ſpeak of, and that there is as little reaſon to admit them both. For thus, for inſtance, though we ſhould allow the word <hi>Bread</hi> to ſignifie <hi>the Body of Chriſt under the ſpecies of Bread,</hi> where the Scripture makes mention of its being <hi>eaten</hi> by the Communicants; Yet can we not allow it the ſame ſignification, where it is affirmed to be the <hi>Communion of Chriſt's Body:</hi> Becauſe that, which is the Communion of any thing, muſt be a diſtinct thing from that, which it pretends to be the Communion of. On the other ſide, though we ſhould allow the word <hi>Bread</hi> to ſignifie only the <hi>ſpecies</hi> thereof, where the Scripture makes mention of its being the <hi>Communion of Chriſt's Body;</hi> Yet can we not with the like reaſon allow it the ſame ſignification, where it is ſaid to be <hi>eaten</hi> by the Communicants: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſuch Bread, as makes the unworthy eaters of it to be <hi>guilty of Chriſt's Body</hi>
                        <note n="(l)" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.27.</note>, which, according to the Doctrine of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts,</hi> nothing but the eating of that Body it ſelf can do. If any thing be to be ſaid in this particular, it muſt be, that the word <hi>Bread</hi> is ſometime to be taken for <hi>the Body of Chriſt under the ſpecies of Bread,</hi> and ſometime alſo for thoſe <hi>ſpecies</hi> themſelves. But beſide that (as <hi>Tully</hi> ſometime ſpake concerning thoſe that aſſign'd Atoms a motion of declination) this is, as it were, to allot words their reſpective Provinces, and preſcribe them what they ſhall ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie in this, or that particular place; I do not ſee how either of theſe ſenſes can, without great violence to the text, be impos'd upon thoſe words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> The <hi>Bread, which we break, is it not the Communion of the Body of Chriſt:</hi> Becauſe if, as is probable enough, the Bread were then broken, as it was in our Saviour's Euchariſt, before the words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> paſs'd upon it, no other Bread can be meant by it, even in the opinions of the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> themſelves, than true, and proper Bread, and not either the Body of Chriſt under the ſpecies of Bread, or the ſpecies of Bread ſeparate from the ſubſtance of it.</p>
                     <p>Agreeable hereto is the teſtimony of <hi>Senſe,</hi> and which is the more conſiderable here, becauſe it hath not only no clear revelation againſt it, but, as appears from the premiſſes, hath plain revelation for it. For whatever pretence may be made againſt the teſtimony of Senſe
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:56517:160"/>where there is any juſt ſurmiſe of revelations being againſt it; Yet can there not certainly be any, where there is not only no ſuch ſurmiſe, but as plain, and expreſs revelation, as can be reaſonably deſir'd: To queſtion our Senſes in ſuch a caſe, being to queſtion revelation alſo, becauſe concurring with the Teſtimony thereof. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if any think that revelation not to be clear enough, becauſe (as hath been ſometime ſuggeſted) St. <hi>Paul</hi> may as well give the title of <hi>Bread</hi> to that <hi>Body</hi> of Chriſt, which was made of it, as <hi>Moſes</hi>
                        <note n="(m)" place="margin">Exod. 7.12.</note> did that of a <hi>Rod</hi> to thoſe <hi>Serpents,</hi> which aroſe from them; It will not be difficult to make anſwer, that that notion can have no place, where St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes it his buſineſs (as he doth, where he recites the Inſtitution) to awe Men into a reverential receit of this Holy Sacrament: To think that St. <hi>Paul</hi> would ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten call that <hi>Bread,</hi> which was a thing infinitely above it, when his Deſign was to awe Men into a reverential receit of it, being to think, he either knew not how to ſuit his Expreſſions to it, or that he baſely, and invidiouſly betray'd it.</p>
                     <p>I will conclude what I have to ſay againſt the ſubſtantial change of the Sacramental Elements, when I have ſhewn from the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,</hi> that ſuch a change was unknown to them. Which I ſhall endeavour to evince <hi>firſt</hi> from what they ſay concerning their <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in the ſame nature,</hi> in which they were before, and then from what they ſay concerning their being <hi>Types,</hi> and <hi>Symbols</hi> and <hi>Images</hi> of that Body, and Blood, into which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> affirm them to be tranſubſtantiated.</p>
                     <p>That the <hi>Antients</hi> repreſented the Sacramental Elements as <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in the ſame nature,</hi> in which they were before, will appear, firſt from what I have elſewhere ſaid<note n="(n)" place="margin">Part 1.</note> concerning their repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting our <hi>Euchariſt</hi> as an <hi>Euchariſt for the things of this World,</hi> and particularly for the <hi>Fruits</hi> of the Earth, as well as for the Body, and Blood of Chriſt, and profeſſing to <hi>eat</hi> of the Bread of it, even when become the Body of Chriſt by Prayer, as a Teſtimony of their <hi>Thankfulneſs</hi> for the other. For how is that an Euchariſt for the things of this World, and particularly for the Fruits of the Earth, which is now all Heavenly, neither hath any thing of an earthly ſuſtenance remaining? Or how we ſaid to eat of the Bread of it in token of ſuch a Thankfulneſs, if there be nothing at all in it of what we profeſs to give thanks for? All other Offerings, beſide this, having ſome affinity with that, which they pretend to be Offerings of Thanks for. Neither will it avail to ſay, which is all that can be ſaid, that our Euchariſt may become ſuch, even for earthly Boons, by the remaining ſpecies thereof. For beſide that the Antients make no mention of any ſuch <hi>ſeparate</hi> ſpecies, and we therefore not to interpret what they ſay of Bread, and other ſuch ſubſtantial things, concerning the bare ſpecies thereof; It is plain from what was before quoted out of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> that that, which was tender'd unto God in this Euchariſtical offering, was the creatures of Bread, and Wine, and from <hi>Origen,</hi> that the Euchariſtical Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſiſted in <hi>eating</hi> of what was tendered to him, as well as in the tendry it ſelf. So that if they were the Creatures of God, that were tender'd to him, and not only the ſpecies thereof, they were the ſame Creatures, and not only the ſpecies thereof, that were
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:56517:160"/>in their opinion eaten, and drunken by them, and conſequently by which they gave thanks to God for the Fruits of the Earth, as well as for the great Bleſſing of our Redemption.</p>
                     <p>But of all the things, that are ſaid by the <hi>Antients</hi> to ſhew their belief of the Sacramental Elements continuing in the ſame nature in which they were before, nothing certainly is of more force than the uſe they make of that relation, which is between them, and Chriſt's Body, and Blood, to ſhew againſt the <hi>Apollinarians,</hi> and <hi>Eutychians,</hi> that the divine, and humane nature, however united in the perſon of Jeſus Chriſt, yet are not ſo made one, as to be confounded, and mixed together, as the <hi>Apollinarians</hi> taught his divine nature, and fleſh to be; or the humane nature to be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up into the divine, as the <hi>Eutychians</hi> did. For to confute each of theſe, and to ſhew the diſtinction there is between the two natures of Chriſt, the Antients alledged the near relation there is between the Sacramental Elements, and Chriſt's Body, and Blood, but which, how near ſoever, doth not confound, or deſtroy the truth of their reſpective natures, but preſerves both the one, and the other of them entire. For thus St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Caeſarius</hi> lately publiſhed<note n="(o)" place="margin">Appendix to the Def. of an Expoſit. of the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>de Meaux.</hi>
                        </note>, againſt the Doctrine of the <hi>Apollinarians. As before the Bread is ſanctified, we name it Bread, but, the divine Grace ſanctifying it through the mediation of the Prieſt, it is freed from the title of Bread, and thought worthy of the title of the Body of the Lord, although the nature of Bread remaineth in it, and it is not ſaid to be two Bodies, but one Body of the Lord; So alſo here the divine nature being placed in the Body, they both together make up one Son, and one perſon, but without confuſion, as well as diviſion, not in one nature, but in two perfect ones.</hi> So that as ſurely as the two natures of Chriſt continue diſtinct, and unconfounded, ſo the Sacramental Elements, and the thing ſignified by them do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe made uſe of to illuſtrate the diſtinction of the other. To the ſame purpoſe, though more clearly, and fully, doth <hi>Theodoret</hi> diſcourſe in his Dialogues againſt the <hi>Eutychians.</hi> For taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in one place<note n="(p)" place="margin">Dial. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>8.</hi>
                        </note> of our Saviour's calling <hi>Bread</hi> by the name of <hi>his Body,</hi> and in like manner his <hi>Fleſh</hi> by the name of <hi>Meat,</hi> he proceeds to give this reaſon of that change of names; To wit, <hi>That he intended thereby to prompt thoſe, that partake of the divine Myſteries, not to attend to the nature of the things, that are ſeen, but by that change of names to give belief to that change, which is made by grace. For he that called his natural Body Meat, and Bread, and again nam'd himſelf a Vine, the very ſame perſon honour'd the Symbols, that are ſeen, with the title of his Body, and Blood, not changing their nature, but adding grace to nature.</hi> And again<note n="(q)" place="margin">

For neither do the myſtical Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:56517:161"/>after their ſanctification, go out of their own nature. For they abide in their former eſſence, and figure, and faſhion, and are viſible, and palpable as they were before. But they are underſtood to be</hi> Blood, <hi>they have been made,</hi> to wit, Symbols of Chriſt's Body, and <hi>what and believ'd, and reverenc'd as being what they are believ'd.</hi> In like manner the natural <hi>Body</hi> of Chriſt, which is the <hi>Archetype</hi> thereof, <hi>hath its former form, and figure, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, and in a word the eſſence of a Body. But after the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection it became immortal, and above corruption, and was thought worthy to ſit at the right hand of God, and is worſhipped by every creature, as being called the Body of the Lord of nature.</hi> So that if the two natures of Chriſt ought to be look'd upon even now as two diſtinct, and different ones, and not one nature ſwallowed up into the other; We alſo, in the opinion of this Holy Man, ought to look upon this Sacrament, and the thing of the Sacrament, as two diſtinct things, and upon the Sacrament in particular, however dignified with a noble relation, yet as of the ſame nature, and figure, and form, as it was before it was advanced to it. For <hi>Theodoret</hi> arguing the diſtinction of Chriſt's two natures from the diſtinction there is between the Sacrament, and the thing of the Sacrament, and particularly from that Sacrament's continuing in its former na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and eſſence, muſt conſequently ſuppoſe that to have been a thing then known, and confeſs'd, as from which otherwiſe he could not reaſonably have argued the other. I am not ignorant indeed, that even theſe paſſages have met with ſubtle evaſions, and ſuch as ſhew in ſome meaſure the art of thoſe, that fram'd them. But as whoſoever ſhall compare them with thoſe words, to which they are apply'd, will find them to be rather ſubtle, than ſolid; So they put ſuch a ſenſe upon the words of their reſpective Authors, as if they ſhould be admitted, would make them look rather like Sophiſters, than Fathers of the Church, like Men, who intended to impoſe upon their Diſciples, rather than to enlighten them in the Truth. For what other would it have been in <hi>Theodoret</hi> to have argued againſt the change of Chriſt's Body into the divine eſſence, from the continuing of the Symbols of it in their eſſence, and figure, and form, if he had meant no more thereby, than that they remained what they were in their <hi>outward appearances,</hi> as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> are willing to underſtand him, or (as they are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time pleas'd to phraſe it) in their <hi>outward ſubſtance?</hi> For ſo the Body of Chriſt alſo might have remain'd as to the outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances thereof, and yet have been as ſubſtantially chang'd into the divine eſſence, or nature, as the Bread of the Sacrament is ſaid to be into the ſubſtance of Chriſt's Body.</p>
                     <p>But beſide that the Antients repreſent the Sacramental Elements as continuing what they were, and thereby ſufficiently impugne that ſubſtantial change of them into Chriſt's Body, and Blood, which this firſt Aſſertion imports; They repreſent them alſo as <hi>Types,</hi> and <hi>Symbols,</hi> and <hi>Images</hi> thereof, and (as we ſhould therefore think) as diſtinct things from them: No like being the ſame with that, to which it is ſaid to be like, nor indeed any more capable of being ſo, than that, which is the moſt different from it. Now how, ſtanding the ſubſtantial change of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:56517:161"/>the Sacramental Elements, can theſe titles be admitted? Or what is there to build that Typicalneſs or Symbolicalneſs, or reſemblance on; Certainly no other than thoſe aiery ſpecies thereof which in the opinion of thoſe, that maintain them, have themſelves no ſubject to uphold them. But as it doth not appear that the Antients believ'd any ſuch ſpecies, and one<note n="(x)" place="margin">Auguſt. ep. ad Dardan. <hi>57.</hi> Tolle ipſa cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porae qualitatibus corporum, non erit ubi ſint; Et ideo neceſſe eſt ut non ſint — Veruntamen ſi moles ipſa corporis, quantacunque vel quantu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacunque ſit, penitus auſeratur, qualitates ejus non erit ubi ſint, quamvis non mole metiendae ſint.</note> of the Learnedeſt of them deni'd the poſſibility thereof; So they ſometime place the Symbolicalneſs of the Sacramental Elements in ſuch properties thereof, as can belong to no other, than their reſpective ſubſtances. For thus they apparently do, when they repreſent them as Symbols of Chriſt's myſtical Body upon the account of their being made up of the ſubſtance of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lal granes, and ſeveral Grapes, as that Body of Chriſt is of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective members of it; This importing the union of ſeveral ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances into a Maſs, or Body, and conſequently that that is much more a ſubſtance, which is made up of an aggregation of them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It appearing from the premiſſes, how little ground there is to believe, that the whole ſubſtance of the Bread is chang'd into the ſubſtance of Chriſt's Body, and the whole ſubſtance of the Wine into the ſubſtance of Chriſt's Blood; We ſhall the leſs need to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern our ſelves in the examination of that, which follows, even that thoſe <hi>ſubſtances of Bread, and Wine are ſo chang'd into the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Chriſt's Body, and Blood, as to retain nothing of what they were before, ſave only the ſpecies thereof.</hi> For if they can in no ſenſe be ſaid to be ſubſtantially chang'd, how much leſs to ſuch a degree as to retain nothing of what they were, ſave only the <hi>ſpecies</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? But as this Aſſertion, whatever it is, hath ſomething peculiar in it in the common underſtanding of the World; So it may not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be amiſs, eſpecially when the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſeems to have made a peculiar Article of it, to conſider it apart, and both enquire what grounds it hath to ſupport it ſelf, and oppoſe proper reaſons to it. In order whereunto I will conſider it as importing <hi>firſt,</hi> that nothing of the ſubſtance of Bread, and Wine remains, and <hi>ſecondly</hi> as importing that the ſpecies, or accidents thereof do.</p>
                     <p>If they, who affirm that nothing of the ſubſtance of the Bread, and Wine remains, mean no more thereby, than that nothing thereof remains in the <hi>form,</hi> or <hi>eſſence of Bread, and Wine,</hi> as one would think they ſhould not, by their affirming them to be chang'd into the ſubſtance of Chriſts Body, and Blood; They may then be thought to ſay ſomewhat, which may ſeem to have ſome foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in thoſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and <hi>This is my Blood,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe words make no mention of any thing elſe, but them. But then as they muſt alſo ſuppoſe, that the <hi>matter</hi> thereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, though in another <hi>form,</hi> or <hi>eſſence,</hi> becauſe otherwiſe the ſubſtance thereof will not be chang'd, but annihilated; So they muſt ſuppoſe too an addition made thereby to the ſubſtance of Chriſt's Body, becauſe a new acceſſion of matter to it. Which being granted, the change will be made, not into the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Chriſt's Body, and Blood, as Tranſubſtantiation was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid to import, but only into that part thereof, into which
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:56517:162"/>they are affirmed to be chang'd. On the other ſide, if they, who affirm that nothing of the ſubſtance of Bread, and Wine remains, mean thereby, that nothing remains in the form of Bread, and Wine, or any other ſubſtance; They then do not only deſtroy the change of them into the ſubſtance of Chriſt's Body, and Blood, becauſe that change ſuppoſeth the former matter of them to abide, though in another form, or eſſence, but take away all pretence of founding that Aſſertion of theirs in <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and <hi>This is my Blood.</hi> For though thoſe words may aſſure me, that the Body, and Blood of Chriſt are there, where I diſcern the ſpecies of the Sacramental Elements to be, and conſequently that, naturally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the ſubſtances of thoſe Elements cannot; Yet as they do not ſo much as hint, that the ſubſtances of thoſe Elements neither are, nor can be there by the extraordinary power of God, ſo they ſay nothing to let us underſtand by what means they are convey'd away, if they do not remain there.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe this Aſſertion imports as well the remaining of the ſpecies, or accidents of the Sacramental Elements, as the not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining of the ſubſtances thereof; Therefore enquire we, ſo far as we may, what the grounds of that part of the Aſſertion are, and, if there be any need of it after ſuch an enquiry, oppoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Arguments to it. For the truth is, that as thoſe accidents are forc'd to ſubſiſt without a ſubject, ſo they ſeem to have no other ſupport, ſave what the neceſſity of a bad cauſe, and a confident aſſeveration can give them. For is there any thing in the nature of an accident to perſuade us, that the thing is ſo much as poſſible, and that though the ſubſtance of the Sacramental Elements remains not, yet the ſpecies, or accidents thereof may? On the contrary they, who believe any ſuch thing as an accident, make the inhering thereof in a ſubject to be of the very eſſence of it, and that at the ſame time it ceaſeth to inhere (as it muſt do, when the ſubject thereof is remov'd) it alſo ceaſeth to be. Is it then, that thoſe ſeparate ſpecies, or accidents have any thing in the words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and <hi>This is my Blood,</hi> to afford them any ſupport? But alas, as the words <hi>my Body,</hi> and <hi>my Blood</hi> are ſo far from giving any countenance to them, that they rather bid defiance to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe profeſſing to contain nothing leſs in them than the Auguſt Body, and Blood of Chriſt; So the word <hi>This</hi> is as much afraid of owning them, for fear it ſhould injure the ſubſtances thereof, and inſtead of betokening the converſion of thoſe into the ſubſtances of Chriſt's Body, and Blood, proclaim the converſion of the ſpecies, or accidents thereof into them, and ſo bid a far greater defiance to our already too much offended Senſes. Shall we then (which is all we have to truſt to at the laſt) appeal to the teſtimony of our Senſes for them? But beſide that no wiſe <hi>Tranſubſtantiator</hi> ought to give any belief to his Senſes, as which will tell him farther, if he liſten to them, that there is the ſubſtance of Bread, and Wine under them; Thoſe Senſes of ours do never repreſent thoſe ſpecies as things diſtinct from their proper ſubſtances, and much leſs as ſeparate from them, but as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in them, and proper characters of them, and ſo leading us more to the contemplation of their reſpective ſubſtances, than to that of their own particular natures. So little reaſon is there to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:56517:162"/>the being of ſuch Species, or Accidents, after their proper Subſtances are remov'd. And there is this ſubſtantial Reaſon againſt it, that the admiſſion of ſuch Species, or Accidents in the Sacrament would render the Teſtimony of our Senſes uncertain in other things: Becauſe whatever Pretence there may be from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation for the being of Chriſt's Body, and Blood in the Sacrament, yet there is no Pretence at all from that for the being of any ſuch ſeparate Species, or Accidents, and we therefore as much at liberty to believe them elſewhere, as there, and ſo boggle at any farther notice, that may be ſuppos'd to come to us by the Species of any thing whatſoever.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The <hi>third</hi> Aſſertion, on which the Doctrine of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation is founded, is that <hi>the true Body, and true Blood of Chriſt, together with his Soul, and Divinity, are under the Species of the Sacramental Elements.</hi> An Aſſertion, which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> ſeem to be ſo confident of, from the words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and, <hi>This is my Blood,</hi> that they make no end of inculcating it, and think all Men either blind, or obſtinate, who will not as readily aſſent to it. But with how little reaſon, and how much againſt it alſo, will ſoon appear, if we compare them together, whether as to that <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Chriſt, which they both profeſs to intreat of, or as to the <hi>being of them in</hi> the Sacrament; There being a manifeſt difference in each of theſe between the Aſſertion I am now upon, and thoſe words from which they profeſs to deduce it. For firſt, whereas the Body, and Blood of Chriſt in the words of our Saviour are his Body, and Blood, as broken, and ſhed at his Crucifixion, and not as they were at the time of our Saviour's uttering thoſe words, or ſince his reſurrection from the Dead; The Body, and Blood of Chriſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to be contain'd under the Species of Bread, and Wine, are the Body, and Blood of Chriſt in that glorious eſtate, wherein they now are, now no more to fall under thoſe Accidents, which they ſometime underwent. For <hi>it is no way repugnant</hi> (ſaith the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>
                        <note n="(s)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 13. cap. 1.</note>) <hi>that our Saviour himſelf ſhould alway ſit at the right hand of the Father in Heaven according to a natural manner of exiſting, and yet nevertheleſs be Sacramentally preſent to us by his ſubſtance in other places after that way of exiſting, which though we can ſcarce expreſs in words, yet we believe to be poſſible to God.</hi> And <hi>again</hi>
                        <note n="(t)" place="margin">Ib. cap. 3.</note>, which ſhews it yet more to ſpeak of Chriſt's glorified Body, <hi>the Faith of the Church hath always been, that preſently after the Conſecration, the true Body, and true Blood of Chriſt, together with his Soul, and Divinity, are under the Species of Bread, and Wine; But the Body indeed under the Species of Bread, and the Blood under the Species of Wine by vertue of the words; but the Body it ſelf under the Species of Wine, and the Blood under the Species of Bread, and the Soul under both by vertue of that natural Connexion, and Concomitancy, by which the parts of Chriſt our Lord, who is now riſen from the Dead, now no more to die, are coupled among themſelves.</hi> Than which what can be more plain, that it is the Body, and Blood of Chriſt, as they now are, which they affirm to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained under the Species of thoſe Elements, and not as broken, and ſhed for us? It is true indeed, that when the ſame <hi>Tridentine</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers come to entreat of the Sacrifice of the Maſs, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:56517:163"/>of that Sacrifice, they may ſeem to ſing another Song, becauſe (as was before<note n="*" place="margin">Part 5.</note> obſerved) repreſenting it as the very ſame Sacrifice with that, which he offer'd up upon the Croſs. But as they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently unſay it again, when they repreſent it as an <hi>unbloody</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and as an Oblation that is made of Chriſt's Body, and Blood under the Species of Bread, and Wine; So they thereby aſcribe the breaking, or ſhedding of this Sacrifice, rather to the Species, under which they are offer'd, than to the Body, and Blood of Chriſt under them. But beſide that there is a manifeſt difference between the Aſſertion I am now upon, and our Saviour's words, as to that <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Chriſt, which they both profeſs to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of; There is no leſs ſignal a difference between them, as to the <hi>exiſtence</hi> of that Body, and Blood of Chriſt in the Sacrament, which will be a yet farther prejudice againſt the inferring of this Aſſertion from them. For whereas the utmoſt, that our Saviour's words can be thought to import, is the ſimple exiſtence of his Body, and Blood in the Sacrament, the Aſſertion we are now upon proceeds to affirm, that they exiſt under the Species of the Sacramental Elements, as that too not only under the Species of their proper Element, but under the one, and the other of them. Which how different it is from the importance of our Saviour's words will not be difficult for thoſe to ſee, who can diſcern any difference between a ſimple affirmation of any thing, and that, which proceeds alſo to determine the <hi>modus</hi> of it. But it will be ſaid, it may be, that though our Saviour's words do not expreſly affirm the exiſting of his Body, and Blood under the Sacramental Species, yet they ſay that, from which it may by juſt conſequence be deduc'd. If they do, I willingly yield they ſay enough to juſtifie the preſent Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; But I ſay withall, that there is nothing in them, which can give countenanee to ſuch a Surmiſe. For beſide that they make no expreſs mention of thoſe Sacramental Species, under which this Body, and Blood are ſuppoſed to exiſt; If they ſay any thing, which may be thought to concern thoſe Species, it muſt be the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>them</hi> alſo into that Body, and Blood, into which their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective ſubſtances are chang'd: That, which our Saviour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd the words over, being, no doubt, Species, as well as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and thoſe Species therefore, as well as their Subſtances, to fall under the ſame change, if thoſe words were intended to effect one.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Now though theſe are Difficulties enough to choak any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Man's Belief, if they do not alſo trouble the Belief of thoſe, who pretend to be the moſt zealous Aſſerters of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation; Yet, leſt either they, or we ſhould want any thing to exerciſe it, or improve the meritoriouſneſs thereof, they proceed to aſſert in expreſs terms, that this <hi>true Body,</hi> and <hi>true Blood</hi> of Chriſt are as <hi>truly, really and ſubſtantially contained in,</hi> or <hi>under thoſe Species,</hi> under which they are affirmed to exiſt. I will not as yet alledge any of thoſe Difficulties, wherewith this Aſſertion is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred, becauſe it may be time enough to do that, when we have enquir'd into the grounds of it. But as thoſe Difficulties are apparent enough to make any Man ſtand upon his guard, when ſuch Aſſertions as theſe are endeavour'd to be impoſ'd upon him;
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:56517:163"/>So one would think they ſhould prevail ſo far with thoſe, who pretend to advance them, as to ſee that they have ſufficient ground for their Confidence in it. Which whether they have, or no, let thoſe Perſons judge, who conſider firſt (what can never be too often inculcated) that whatever ground there is for a ſubſtantial Preſence in the words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and, <hi>This is my Blood,</hi> it is for the ſubſtantial Preſence of a Body <hi>broken,</hi> and Blood <hi>ſhed</hi> (for ſo the very Letter of the Text informs us) and not for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Preſence of glorified ones. Neither will it avail to ſay, that they alſo affirm them to be broken, and ſhed in their reſpective Species, and ought not therefore to be debarr'd the uſe of thoſe words for the proof of that ſubſtantial Preſence, which they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance. For as it is evident that they mean no more thereby, than that thoſe Species are broken, and ſhed, as appears from their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the immolation of Chriſt himſelf as a bloodleſs one; So it is alike evident therefore that they mean not ſuch a Body, and Blood as the Text advanceth, and ought not therefore to argue the ſubſtantial Preſence thereof from it. But let us ſuppoſe that our Saviour, and the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Fathers meant one and the ſame Body, and Blood, I mean Chriſt's glorified ones, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that ſo far forth they have a right to make uſe of the preſent words; yet how doth it appear that any ſubſtantial Preſence of that Body, and Blood can be inferred from them? What is there in the Words themſelves, that can give any countenance to it? If there be any thing in the words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and, <hi>This is my Blood,</hi> that may be thought to look that way, it is manifeſtly that <hi>[Is],</hi> which connects the Subject, and Predicate together, becauſe the word, which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves make uſe of to preſs us with the Belief of that ſubſtantial Preſence, which they inculcate. But what reaſon have they to take that for a proof of a ſubſtantial Preſence of Chriſt's glorified Body, and Blood, which in their own opinion doth not reach it, becauſe having a reſpect only to that whether Body, or Blood, to which it is prefix'd, and not (as it muſt, and ought to be, to betoken a ſubſtantial Preſence of a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Chriſt) to both of them together. For though the <hi>Triden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Fathers aſſert, that the glorified Body, and Blood of Chriſt are contain'd indifferently under the Species of either Element, yet only the Body under the Species of Bread, and the Blood under the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Wine by vertue of the words; And the word <hi>[Is]</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not of ſufficient force to prove any ſubſtantial Preſence of them. Becauſe Chriſt's glorified Body, and Blood, though they may be vertually, and objectively preſent to us, when conſider'd apart, yet cannot be ſubſtantially preſent, but by a real Union, and Connexion, as they themſelves have taught us to believe.</p>
                     <p>Now as, where there is ſo little ground for the belief of a ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Preſence, there may be place for alledging Arguments againſt it both from <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> (For though <hi>Senſe,</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> ſhould be of no force againſt the certain Revelations of God, yet nothing hinders but they may be, where no ſuch Revelation doth appear) ſo eſpecially, if we find that the Arguments, which they offer, are ſuch as are confirm'd to us by Revelation, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner put into our mouths by it. For ſuch I account that, which
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:56517:164"/>
                        <hi>Senſe</hi> offers us for that's being <hi>Bread,</hi> and not a <hi>humane Body,</hi> which is put into our Hands, or Mouths, and from thence tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to our Stomachs; Our Eye, and Touch, and Taſte aſſuring us that it is Bread, and not the Body of a Man under the Species of Bread, and much leſs that glorified Body, which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> would perſwade us into. For what other is that Argument, for the ſubſtance thereof I mean, which our Saviour ſometime offer'd to his Diſciples to prove the Body, in which he appeared to them, to be a real Body, and not a Spirit under the appearances of one? For, <hi>handle me</hi> (ſaith he<note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 24.39.</note>) <hi>and ſee; For a Spirit hath not Fleſh, and Bones, as ye ſee me have.</hi> For there, as well as we here, our Saviour appeal'd to the Senſes of his Diſciples for the reality, and ſubſtantialneſs of that Body of his, which then preſented it ſelf to their Eyes; And there too, as well as we do here, he appeal'd to the Teſtimony of the ſame Senſes, that it was not a thing different from a body, even a <hi>Spirit.</hi> Which laſt particular is the more to be taken notice of, as becauſe, according to that, the Teſtimony of Senſe may be a ſufficient Evidence of the not being of a thing, that appears not, as well as of the being of a thing, that doth; So becauſe (as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> order the matter concerning the glorified Body of Chriſt in the Sacrament) there is no material difference, if any at all, between that glorified Body of his, and what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in the place before quoted calls a <hi>Spirit:</hi> They repreſenting that Body as preſent in an inviſible, and impalpable manner, which is the very preſence of a Spirit. By the ſame reaſon therefore that our Saviour might argue from his own falling under their Eye, and Touch, that that ſubſtance, wherein he preſented himſelf to them, was a Body, and not a Spirit; By the ſame reaſon may we argue that that, which our Senſes aſſure us to be Bread, is really ſuch, and not ſuch a Body as, according to the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> is an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and impalpable one, and ſo far forth of the nature of a Spirit. Of the ſame force, as well as nature, I judge the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which <hi>Reaſon</hi> offers againſt the ſubſtantial Preſence of Chriſt's Body in the Sacrament, and particularly that, which it offers to us from the impoſſibility of a Body's being in ſo many places at once, as the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation obligeth us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve concerning the Body of Chriſt. For what other is that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, which the Angels offer'd to the Women<note n="(x)" place="margin">Mat. 28.6.</note>, that ſought Chriſt in the Grave after he was riſen from it? <hi>He is not here, for he is riſen, as he ſaid; Come, ſee the place, where the Lord lay.</hi> For by the ſame reaſon, that Chriſt's Body could not be in the Grave, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was riſen, and departed from it; By the ſame reaſon it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in this, or that particular place on Earth, now it is departed from the whole of it to Heaven, and ſitteth at the right hand of God there. And I muſt needs ſay, I could not therefore but wonder, when I read in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>
                        <note n="(y)" place="margin">

For as they thereby ſufficiently intimate, that even the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Body of our Saviour cannot be in Heaven, and here after its natural manner of exiſting; So ſetting aſide the diſguiſe of the word
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:56517:164"/>
                        <hi>Sacramentally,</hi> that Council ſays nothing at all to hinder our belief of its falling into that very abſurdity it ſelf. For underſtanding by <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally</hi> no other than <hi>ſubſtantially,</hi> and which accordingly they juſt before expreſs by the ſame term, as well as in other places<note n="(z)" place="margin">Ib. Can. 1.</note> of that <hi>Seſſion,</hi> they muſt conſequently (becauſe it is a corporeal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, whereof they ſpeak) be thought to mean <hi>corporally</hi> alſo, which is certainly its natural manner of exiſting. For if to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially preſent be no other, than to be preſent after the manner of a ſubſtance; to be ſubſtantially preſent, when applied to ſuch, or ſuch a ſort of ſubſtance, muſt be to be preſent after the manner of ſuch, or ſuch a ſubſtance; and conſequently, if we ſpeak of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal ſubſtance, to be coporally preſent, or after the manner of a Body, and not after the manner of a Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Theſe <hi>four</hi> Capital Aſſertions being thus deſtroy'd, and ſhewn to be both without Reaſon, and againſt it, we ſhall not need to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern our ſelves much about the other two, as being only the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſectaries thereof, and therefore falling together with them. For if the Body, and Blood of Chriſt be not ſubſtantially in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, there can be no ground, even in the opinion of the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> for <hi>worſhipping Chriſt with Divine Worſhip</hi> in it; And there can be as little Pretence for his being <hi>really</hi> eaten in it, as well as <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,</hi> and <hi>ſacramentally.</hi> Only becauſe theſe two Aſſertions are as much ſtood upon as any of the other, and the former is alſo of perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious conſequence, I think it not amiſs to ſay ſomewhat to each of them, and firſt to the worſhipping Chriſt with Divine Worſhip in it.</p>
                     <p>And here in the firſt place, I cannot but obſerve, that however the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Fathers may in ſome places ſeem to confine this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip to Chriſt as preſent in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Euchariſt (For ſo they do both in the Reaſon they<note n="*" place="margin">

                        </note> ſpeak of the very ſame <hi>God being preſent in it</hi>) than that the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Fathers meant by the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:56517:165"/>former words the <hi>Sacrament</hi> properly ſo ſtil'd, even thoſe ſpecies, under which they elſewhere affirm Chriſt to be, and that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly they requir'd divine worſhip to be given to them? And, if that was their meaning, that they thereby requir'd divine worſhip to be given to Creatures, yea the moſt imperfect ones, and ſuch too, as becauſe not inhering in that Body of Chriſt, which is ſaid to be under them, cannot be ſuppos'd to be perſonally united to him? Than which what can be ſaid, that doth more entrench upon the divine honour, yea upon the honour of that Chriſt, whom they pretend to worſhip in this Sacrament? Thoſe ſpecies, though no part at all of him, being yet joyn'd in equal honour with him; that, which is in effect but the ſhadow of a meer Creature, with the great Creatour, and Redeemer of the World.</p>
                     <p>But let us ſuppoſe that thoſe Fathers meant no more by the word <hi>Sacrament,</hi> than <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in it, and conſequently that ſo far forth there is no pretence for the charge of Idolatry in this affair; Yet how will the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> acquit themſelves from it, ſuppoſing (as we often may) that the Elements are not rightly conſecrated, and no real preſence therefore of Chriſt's Body, and Blood under the ſpecies of them? For in that caſe their worſhip muſt be terminated on the Bread, becauſe there is nothing elſe to receive it. Now that the ſuppoſition I before made is no way unreaſonable, will appear from their affirming that the intention of the Miniſter to do at leaſt, what the Church enjoyns,<note n="(c)" place="margin">Seſſ. 17. can. 11.</note> is requir'd to the making of a Sacrament. For what if the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Miniſter, when he comes to the words of Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wander from the matter in hand? Or, if not ſo, yet doth not aim to do what the Church doth, as they, that believe not Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, certainly cannot, of which number<note n="(d)" place="margin">See Pref. to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Holy Euch. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> there are not a few? Or (which is worſt of all) as a Prieſt is ſometime ſaid to have directed his<note n="(e)" place="margin">Meric Caſaub. Neceſſ. <hi>of</hi> Reſ. <hi>p. 75.</hi>
                        </note> for ſeven, or eight years together, be ſet upon doing honour to the Devil, rather than to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt? In each of theſe caſes certainly there can be no real conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Elements into the Body, and Blood of Chriſt, and therefore they, that pay adoration to them, rather worſhippers of the Creature, than of him, who was the Inſtitutor of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. And I know not of any tolerable evaſion in this affair, ſave what is ſaid to have been ſuggeſted by <hi>Gerſon,</hi> even by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping the hoſt <hi>conditionally,</hi> and upon ſuppoſition of its being the Body of Chriſt. But as that is a ſort of worſhipping, which few of the unlearned are acquainted with, and which can do no great good to thoſe, that are; Such an uncertainty, as that, being as likely to take off the edge of their devotions, as to help them in the directing of their intentions; So that cannot however hinder the external act from being fixed upon the Creature, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cannot but make the door of that external act guilty of material Idolatry, though not of any formal one. Which material Idolatry, though it may not perhaps reflect upon the worſhipper, becauſe of his invincible ignorance in this affair; Yet, which is worſe, will, if ſuppos'd, reflect upon God for not providing againſt it in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny caſes as may happen: Eſpecially, if the like intention be either wanting, or perverted in the perſon, that baptiz'd, or ordained
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:56517:165"/>the Conſecrater, becauſe then all he doth at any time will be null. For how is it conſiſtent with the honour, or goodneſs of that God, who was in their opinion ſo gracious to his Church as to furniſh it with an infallible guide, not to provide againſt ſo many members of it paying their external adoration to a piece of Bread, at the ſame time they deſir'd, and intended to addreſs it to his Son?</p>
                     <p>I will conclude my diſcourſe of this aſſertion when I have taken notice of one piece of Sophiſtry, which is employ'd by the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> to ſave themſelves from the imputation of Idolatry, though there ſhould be no ſuch thing as Tranſubſtantiation in the World; That I mean, which they alledge, and our <hi>Taylour</hi>
                        <note n="(f)" place="margin">Liberty of Proph. Sect. 20. num. 16.</note> in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, concerning their directing their worſhip, not to Bread, which they believe not to be preſent, but to the Body, and Blood of Chriſt, or rather to Chriſt in perſon, whom they conceive to be corporally preſent in it. But as they do not, I confeſs, <hi>intentionally</hi> direct their worſhip to Bread, or at leaſt not to Bread, as ſuch, becauſe they believe it not to continue, where they direct their worſhip; So I do not ſee how that hinders their directing it <hi>indeed,</hi> and <hi>in truth</hi> to Bread, ſuppoſing that not to be tranſubſtantiated into Chriſt's Body: Becauſe as their outward worſhip is manifeſtly directed to that ſubſtance, which is under the ſpecies of Bread; So believing, as they do, that that Subſtance is Chriſt's Body, they muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be thought to direct their inward worſhip alſo to it, and, if therefore there be nothing elſe there, to ſimple Bread. And I know of nothing, that can excuſe them in this point, unleſs it be their own miſtake, which how far it will avail them in this particular, I, for my part, ſhall not take upon me to determine. But as that miſtake of theirs will not however change the nature of the action, or make it ceaſe to be the adoration of a Creature; So it will not change it in the ſight of God, if the miſtake be groſs, and affected, which they have juſt cauſe to look after, who have ſo little ground from Scripture for the belief of that Tranſubſtantiation, which is the foundation of it, and ſo much againſt it from the ſame Scripture, and Antiquity, and Senſe, and Reaſon, which are all the Topicks we can argue from.</p>
                     <p>Next to the worſhipping of Chriſt as preſent in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, conſider we our <hi>really</hi> eating him in it, as well as either <hi>ſpiritually,</hi> or <hi>ſacramentally.</hi> A thing, as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves confeſs, which depends upon his being ſubſtantially there, and muſt therefore fall of courſe with that ſubſtantial preſence, which I have before deſtroy'd. But as this Aſſertion is not without weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its own, and would therefore be conſidered apart; So I think it therefore but reaſonable to be more particular in the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it, than would otherwiſe be neceſſary for me to be.</p>
                     <p>And here in the firſt place I cannot but obſerve, that where the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> intreats of this affair, it oppoſeth <hi>real,</hi> as well as <hi>ſacramental</hi> manducation to that, which is <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> as if the latter, though undoubtedly the principal, were an imaginary one. But as we gain thus much by it, that that Council by <hi>real</hi> muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently mean a corporal one, ſo I ſhall therefore make no farther uſe of that oppoſition at preſent, than to enquire into the truth of that <hi>real</hi> manducation underſtood as is before deſcrib'd.</p>
                     <pb n="244" facs="tcp:56517:166"/>
                     <p>In order whereunto that, which I ſhall in the next place take notice of, is, that the word <hi>manducare,</hi> which the Council makes uſe of, ſignifies primarily, and properly <hi>chewing,</hi> and conſequently, where intended to denote a corporal manducation, ought to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of ſuch a one, as is made by the breaking of the thing eaten by the Teeth. And indeed, as this is the true corporal manducati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and which alone therefore deſerves the name of a real one; So the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> appears to have been heretofore of the ſame mind by the recantation it put into the Mouth of <hi>Berengarius:</hi> The words thereof, ſo far, being<note n="(g)" place="margin">Baron. Annal. Eccl. ad Ann. <hi>1059.</hi>
                        </note>, that <hi>he believ'd the true Body of Chriſt to be ſenſually, not only in Sacrament, but in truth handled, and broken by the hands of the Prieſt, and ground in pieces by the Teeth of the faithful.</hi> And thus if the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> were ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, they might pretend to a <hi>real</hi> manducation indeed, and ſuch as had ſome title to that name, which they beſtow upon it. But as they ſaw ſuch a manducation to agree but ill with that glorious Body, to which they aſcrib'd it, and have not therefore fail'd to ſet a brand upon thoſe words, which were made uſe of to expreſs the Churches mind; So they now put off that manducation to thoſe <hi>Capernaites,</hi> to whom our Saviour diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd in St. <hi>John</hi> concerning eating his Fleſh, and drinking his Blood, and make that to be the very eating, which our Saviour faulted them for the imagination of, and not that more refined one, which they themſelves advance.</p>
                     <p>But what then is that real manducation, or eating of Chriſt, which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> advance? What is that, which they think fit to give that name unto? Nothing, for ought that I can diſcern, ſave the receiving of him with their mouth, and tranſmitting him from thence into their ſtomachs. If there be any thing elſe, that looks like manducation, the poor <hi>ſpecies</hi> are fain to bear it; For that is the Sum, and ſubſtance of their eating Chriſt in them. But in conſcience can this manducation of Chriſt look like a real one? Is this anſwerable to that literal ſenſe, which they ſeem to be ſo fond of in other things? For why, if the letter of the text per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuades that the very Body of Chriſt is in the Sacrament, as that too not figuratively, or ſpiritually, but properly, and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, ſhould not the ſame letter perſuade, that it is eaten as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally, and properly, and not only ſpiritually, and ſacramentally? Eſpecially, when they themſelves advance a real manducation, as well as a ſacramental, and ſpiritual one. But as they, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſo eagerly for the very Body of Chriſt being in the Sacrament, and (which is more) will have it to be ſubſtantially there, do yet arbitrarily enough aſſert its being only <hi>ſpiritually</hi> there, or after the manner of a Spirit; So out of the ſame meer will, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure they aſſert alſo a <hi>real</hi> manducation, and yet at the ſame time make that <hi>real</hi> manducation to be no other than Mens receiving Chriſt's Body into their Mouths, and tranſmitting it from thence into their Stomachs. As if our Saviour had given them an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Empire over his words, and empower'd them to give thoſe words a proper, and improper Senſe, as beſt ſuited with their own <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> and intereſts. For if the letter of the words will prevail ſo far as to make us underſtand the eating enjoyn'd of ſuch
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:56517:166"/>an eating as is performed by the Mouth, I do not ſee, without the Empire before ſpoken of, why they ſhould not underſtand it of ſuch an eating, as is alſo performed by the Teeth, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs (as <hi>Berengarius</hi> was taught to do) that the Body of Chriſt is <hi>ſenſually, not in Sacrament, but in truth handled, and broken by the hands of the Prieſt, and ground in pieces by the Teeth of the Faithful.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſide, to what purpoſe any <hi>corporal</hi> eating at all? To what purpoſe our ſo much as receiving Chriſt with our Mouths, and tranſmitting him from thence into our Stomachs? when, for ought appears by the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> it ſelf, this Sacrament of Chriſt's Body, and Blood was intended not for the corporal nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Bodies, but for the ſpiritual nouriſhment of our Souls: That Council where it profeſſeth to intreat of the Reaſon of the Inſtitution of this moſt holy Sacrament<note n="(h)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 13. cap. 2.</note>, affirming only, that <hi>our Saviour would have this Sacrament to be taken as the Spiritual Food of Souls, whereby they are nouriſhed, and ſtrengthened, living by the Life of him, that ſaid, He, that eateth me, even he ſhall live by me.</hi> For ſuch as the Food is, ſuch in reaſon ought to be that eating, by which it is to be receiv'd; And therefore, if the Body of Chriſt in the Sacrament were intended for the Spiritual Food of our Souls, to be ſpiritually eaten alſo, and not after a corporal manner. But that, which will ſhew yet more the no neceſſity there is of this <hi>corporal</hi> eating of Chriſt's Body, any more than of that Body's being really, and locally preſent in the Sacrament, is what is aſſign'd by <hi>Monſ.

                        <p>An account of that Doctrine, which is by us called Conſubſtantiation, out of the Auguſtan Confeſſion, and <hi>Gerhard;</hi> And as it is founded by him, and other the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Doctors in the letter of the words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and, <hi>This is my Blood,</hi> ſo Enquiry there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon made <hi>firſt,</hi> whether thoſe words ought to be taken in the literal ſenſe; Secondly, whether, if ſo taken, Conſubſtantiation can be inferred from them. That the former words ought to be taken in the literal ſenſe is endeavour'd by the <hi>Lutherans</hi> to be prov'd by <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi> and <hi>ſpecial</hi> Arguments, and thoſe Arguments therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, and anſwer'd. What is alledg'd in the <hi>general</hi> concerning the literal ſenſe of Scripture being for the moſt part to be preferr'd before the figurative, willingly allowd; But that no exception ought to be made, unleſs where the Scripture it ſelf obligeth us to depart from the literal ſenſe, ſhewn to be neither true in it ſelf, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to the preſent Texts, becauſe there is enough in the words, that follow them, to oblige us to preferr the figurative ſenſe before it. The <hi>Lutherans ſpecial</hi> Arguments next brought under Conſideration, and Firſt that, which is drawn from the ſuppoſed <hi>newneſs,</hi> and <hi>ſtrangeneſs</hi> of the Chriſtian Sacraments at the firſt, and which conſequently requir'd, that they ſhould be deliver'd in proper, and literal Expreſſions, as without which otherwiſe there could have been no certain knowledge of them. Where is ſhewn, that the Chriſtian Sacraments were neither ſuch new, and ſtrange things at the firſt Inſtitution of them, as is pretended (There having been the like under the <hi>Old</hi> Teſtament) nor under any neceſſity, if they had been ſuch, of being delivered in literal, and proper Expreſſions, becauſe figurative Expreſſions, with a Key to open them, might have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently declar'd the nature of them. What is urg'd in the ſecond place from the nature of a <hi>Teſtament,</hi> under the form of which this Sacrament is thought from <hi>Luke 22.20.</hi> to have been inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, ſhewn to be of as little force; Partly, becauſe it is juſtly
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:56517:170"/>queſtionable, whether what we there render <hi>Teſtament,</hi> ought not rather to be render'd a <hi>Covenant;</hi> and partly becauſe even <hi>Civil</hi> Teſtaments are ſhewn to admit of figurative Expreſſions. A ſhort Anſwer made to what is alledg'd in the third, and fourth place from the Majeſty of him, that inſtituted this Sacrament, and from the ſuppoſed Conformity there is between the ſeveral Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> in their accounts of the words in queſtion; And a more full one to what is offer'd in the fifth place to ſhew the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of a figurative Senſe from the no place there is for it either in the <hi>Subject, Predicate,</hi> or <hi>Copula.</hi> The <hi>Copula,</hi> or the word <hi>[Is]</hi> thereupon made choice of to place the Figure in, and anſwer made to what is objected againſt it from the Rules of <hi>Logick,</hi> and from the <hi>Scripture.</hi> That the literal Senſe is not, as is pretended in the ſixth Argument, the only one that can quiet the Mind, or ſecure the Conſcience, briefly ſhewn; And Enquiry next made, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther though the literal Senſe of the words ſhould be allow'd, <hi>Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation</hi> could be inferred from them. Which that it cannot, is made appear from there being nothing in the word <gap reason="foreign">

Whereof the former are, that the literal ſenſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the firſt, and moſt natural, is generally to be prefer'd before the figurative one; That this ought eſpecially to be obſerv'd in the Interpretation of the Scripture, unleſs the Scripture it ſelf oblige us to depart from it, but moſt of all in divine Precepts, Promiſes, and Articles of Faith: Partly, becauſe of the danger there may be of running into great errours, if the literal ſenſe ſhould not generally be adhered to, and partly becauſe it is pretended that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the former nature, which in ſome place of Scripture, or other is not delivered in plain, and literal expreſſions, and by which judgment may be made of what is elſewhere deliver'd in figurative ones. And I willingly grant that the literal ſenſe, becauſe the firſt, and moſt natural, is generally to be prefer'd before the figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative; And I grant too, that this ought eſpecially to be obſerv'd in the Interpretation of the Scripture. But that no exception ought to be made from this <hi>general</hi> rule, unleſs the Scripture it ſelf oblige us to depart from the literal ſenſe, is a thing I ſee no reaſon for, where the matter intreated of is a proper matter of Reaſon, or of that law of Nature, which is conducted by it: Partly, becauſe in ſuch a caſe Reaſon, and Nature may be preſum'd to be competent judges of the thing intreated of, and conſequently may preſcribe againſt the literal ſenſe of ſuch expreſſions, as ſhall be found to be manifeſtly contrary to the dictates of it; And partly, becauſe the great deſign of Scripture being to direct us in ſupernatural things, it may well enough be preſum'd to leave things of the former na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be judg'd of, for the main, by that Reaſon, to whoſe cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance they do belong. Thus, for inſtance, becauſe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of thoſe natures, which God hath given us, is a thing proper enough for the cogniſance of Reaſon, and Nature, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly preſcrib'd by the dictates of it, not only we, but all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians whatſoever think themſelves licenſed, if not oblig'd, to put a figurative ſenſe upon thoſe words, which command <hi>the pulling out an offending eye,</hi> or <hi>cutting off an offending hand,</hi> yea though there ſhould not be, as perhaps there is not, any ſo expreſs precept of Scripture againſt the mutilation of our ſelves. But let us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine yet more nearly the purport of the former Argument, as it relates to ſuch divine precepts, and promiſes, as may ſeem to have a more particular regard to the life to come, and ſo may be rather reckoned to ſupernatural truths, than moral ones. For neither here is it ſo clear that the literal ſenſe is to prevail, unleſs ſome text be produced, which ſhall oblige us to the contrary; Neither, if it were, would it be of force to conclude againſt a figurative in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of thoſe words, for which this Argument is alledged.
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:56517:171"/>I inſtance for the former of theſe in what was but even now<note n="†" place="margin">Part 7.</note> quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> concerning our looking upon that as a figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative expreſſion, which enjoyns the <hi>eating of Chriſt's Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>drinking his Blood</hi> in order to eternal life. For as that <hi>Father</hi> thought it enough to prove that expreſſion to be ſuch, becauſe it ſeem'd to command a great wickedneſs, without ſo much as taking notice of any Scripture, that repreſented it as ſuch; ſo I do not ſee what text can be produc'd, that is ſo expreſs againſt the eating of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Fleſh, and drinking humane Blood, as this is for the eating, and drinking them in the preſent inſtance. In which caſe, that wickedneſs, which St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> affirms the former precept to lead to in the literal ſenſe, muſt be pronounc'd as ſuch by the law of Reaſon, and Nature, and no neceſſity therefore of ſticking to the literal ſenſe of any Scripture, till we can find as expreſs a text elſewhere to take us off from the embracing of it. But let us ſuppoſe that the literal ſenſe is to prevail, till ſome text of Scripture can be produc'd, which ſhall oblige us to a contrary one; Yet will it not therefore follow, but that the words, we are now upon, may, and ought to be figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively taken, becauſe there is enough in thoſe, that follow, to oblige us to it. I alledge for this purpoſe our Saviour's repreſenting the things he gave as his Body <hi>broken,</hi> and Blood <hi>ſhed,</hi> which his natural Body, and Blood were not at the Inſtitution of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor can now be ſince his Reſurrection from the dead. For if the Body, and Blood of Chriſt were not then <hi>broken,</hi> or <hi>ſhed,</hi> nor can be ſo ſince his Reſurrection from the dead, what our Saviour then gave, or we now receive, cannot be that Body, and Blood, and therefore to be underſtood rather as Signs, and efficacious Means of conveying the Merit of that Body, and Blood to us, than (as the letter of the words ſeems to import) that <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> it ſelf. The ſame is yet more evident from our Saviour's requiring his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to do that whole action, and particularly to eat, and drink the things given <hi>in remembrance of him,</hi> and <hi>of his death?</hi> That which is deſign'd as a <hi>memorial</hi> of any thing, being in reaſon to be look'd upon as a thing diſtinct from that, which it was intended as a memorial of, and deſign'd to ſupply the place of. Neither will it avail to ſay (as it is in my opinion idly enough) that if the laſt ſuggeſtion were true, Chriſt's Body, and Blood muſt have been abſent from that Sacrament, which our Saviour celebrated with his Diſciples, which it is certain from the Story, that they were not. For as that Sacrament it ſelf was principally deſign'd for the times ſucceeding our Saviour's paſſion, and the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or <hi>remembrance,</hi> in all probability made uſe of with a particular relation to them; So Chriſt's Body <hi>broken</hi> and Blood <hi>ſhed</hi> were as much abſent from that Table, and Sacrament, as they are from our Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Tables, or any other.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe <hi>general</hi> Arguments of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> being of no more force, let us caſt our eyes upon their <hi>ſpecial</hi> ones, or at leaſt upon ſuch of them, as ſeem moſt worthy of our regard. Whereof the firſt, that occurs, is taken from the nature of a Sacrament, which (as they ſay) being a thing perfectly new, and accordingly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to all Men, till it come to be reveal'd, is in reaſon to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in proper and literal expreſſions, as concerning which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:56517:171"/>there can be no certain knowledg. Which ſuppos'd, the words, that declare this Sacrament, muſt be concluded to be ſuch, and as ſuch underſtood, and aſſerted. A Man would wonder to hear Learned Men argue at this rate concerning the Sacraments of our Saviour, when it appears by what I have elſewhere<note n="(‖)" place="margin">Expl. of the Sacr. in Gen. Part 4.</note> ſaid, that there were ſeveral ſuch things before, and by which St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that the Jews did all <hi>eat the ſame ſpiritual meat</hi> with us, and <hi>drank the ſame ſpiritual drink,</hi> even <hi>Chriſt;</hi> Yea though the natural Body, and Blood of Chriſt were not then in being, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently could not literally be eaten, or drunken. For how come our Sacraments to be ſuch new, and unknown things, when there were the like long before? Or how under a neceſſity of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd in literal, and proper expreſſions, when there were not only ſuch like Sacraments to give light to them, though figuratively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, but the Doctrine of thoſe Antient Sacraments deliver'd even by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in thoſe very figurative expreſſions, which are thought to be ſuch abſurdities in ours? For however <hi>we</hi> may be thought literally to eat, and drink Chriſt's Body, and Blood; yet <hi>they,</hi> to be ſure, cannot be thought to have done ſo, who liv'd before that Body, and Blood of Chriſt were in being. Though granting that our Sacraments were at firſt as new, and unknown, as it is pretended that they are; Yet will it not therefore follow, but that they might be delivered in figurative, as well as in literal expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Becauſe figurative expreſſions, according to themſelves may be eaſily enough underſtood, if there be but a Key to open them. Now whether there be not ſuch a Key to open the figurative ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the preſent Sacrament, I ſhall leave to thoſe to judge, who ſhall reflect upon our Saviour's repreſenting the Symbols of this Sacrament as his Body <hi>broken,</hi> and Blood <hi>ſhed,</hi> and willing us moreover to eat, and drink of them in remembrance of him, and of his crucifixion; Thoſe two things being enough to aſſure us, that the things given by our Saviour were rather <hi>Memorials</hi> of that Body, and Blood of his, and <hi>conveyers</hi> of the Merits of them, than either the ſubſtance of that Body, and Blood, or the Means of communicating it to the Mouths, and Stomachs of thoſe, who were to partake of them.</p>
                     <p>But it may be there is more force in what they argue from the nature of a <hi>Teſtament</hi> upon occaſion of thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>This is my Blood of the New Teſtament,</hi> or <hi>The New Teſtament in it, which is ſhed for many for the remiſſion of Sins.</hi> For ſince it ſhould ſeem by thoſe expreſſions, that that Sacrament was inſtituted under the form of a <hi>Teſtament,</hi> the words whereof ought in reaſon to be taken in the literal ſenſe, as without which all <hi>Teſtaments</hi> would be very uncertain, and litigious; Therefore the words of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and particularly ſuch of them as reſpect the principal Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in it, ought to be taken in the literal ſenſe, and not in a figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative one.

But I will however allow for once the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:56517:172"/>uſual rendring of the <hi>Word,</hi> and anſwer directly to that Argument, which is formed from it. As indeed what ſhould hinder me, when thoſe very Laws, which they pretend to, do not prove what they are deſigned for? For ſuch I look upon that<note n="(b)" place="margin">Ille, aut ille D. de legat. &amp; fidei commiſſ.</note>, which ſaith, that, <hi>when there is no ambiguity in the words, there ought to be no queſtion made concerning the Will of the Teſtatour.</hi> For who will allow theſe Men to ſuppoſe, that there is no ambiguity in the words of the preſent <hi>Teſtament</hi> ſtrictly, and literally underſtood, and particularly in thoſe words, that are the ſubject of the preſent controverſie? As little force is there in that Law<note n="(c)" place="margin">L. Non ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter D. de le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatis, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note>, which ſaith, that <hi>we ought not otherwiſe to depart from the natural ſignification of words, than when it is manifeſt that the Teſtatour meant ſomewhat elſe,</hi> than what ſeems to have been expreſſed in them. For one would think, that ſhould conſider what impoſſibilities, and contradictions the literal ſenſe of, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and <hi>This is my Blood,</hi> involves, one would think, I ſay, that thoſe alone ſhould make it manifeſt enough, that the Teſtatour meant ſomewhat elſe, than what the literal ſenſe of the words will neceſſarily lead Men to. So little reaſon is there to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that there is any thing even in the <hi>Civil</hi> Law to perſuade a ſtrict, and literal interpretation of all, that a Teſtament contains. And they, who produce the two former Laws to perſuade ſuch an Interpretation, are the more inexcuſable in it, becauſe if they had pleas'd to read on to the paragraph <hi>Titius</hi> in the latter of them, they would have ſeen enough to make them aſham'd of their pretenſions; Becauſe it is there affirm'd in expreſs terms, that <hi>we are not in a cauſe of Teſtaments to deſcend to a ſtrict definition of words, ſince for the moſt part Teſtatours ſpeak abuſively, neither do they always uſe proper Names, and Titles.</hi> All which things I have ſaid, not as conſtrain'd thereto by the force of the preſent Argument (For I know no reaſon why the ſenſe of the <hi>New</hi> Teſtament ſhould be judg'd of by the niceties of the Law) but to let the World ſee, how partial Men are in the allegations of ſuch proofs as they think to be of uſe to them.

                        <hi>his ſenſe is more to be regarded, than the words.</hi> Which could have no ſenſe in it, if Legitimate Teſtaments were alway to be taken in the ſtrictneſs of the letter; For then the will, or ſenſe of the Teſtatour, and the words of his Teſtament would be perfectly the ſame.</p>
                     <p>The next argument for the literal ſenſe of the words in queſtion is taken from the Majeſty of him, that inſtituted this Sacrament, and from all thoſe glorious Attributes, that make it up. Such as are his Truth, and the place he holds under God of our Inſtructer, his being the very wiſdom of the Father, and omniſcient, his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nigh unto death, when he inſtituted this Sacrament, and ſo much the more likely ſtill to weigh all the words he utter'd in this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant affair; as, in fine, his being ſo far from giving any indication of other than a literal Interpretation of the preſent words, that, when he was advanced to Heaven, he reveal'd the Doctrine of the Euchariſt in the very ſame words, wherein he had before exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it. Things, which for the moſt part, muſt be acknowledg'd
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:56517:172"/>to be duly attributed to Chriſt; but which have no force at all to conclude the thing in queſtion. For what if Chriſt be <hi>true,</hi> and appointed by God to be our <hi>Inſtructer?</hi> Will it therefore follow, that we muſt underſtand all he ſaith in the Letter, though we want not ſufficient Indications, even from ſome of his own words, that we ought to underſtand him in a figurative ſenſe. All that they, who preſs us with Chriſt's Truth, and the Place he holds under God, ſeem to pretend to, is, that we ought to hear him, and be guided by him in our Belief. Which I ſuppoſe they do to very good purpoſe, who ſubmit their Belief to that, which, all things conſider'd, they are firmly perſwaded to be his Mind, and Will. But it is farther alledg'd, that Chriſt is the very Wiſdom of the Father, and one who could therefore expreſs his Mind clearly, and plainly, and in proper and literal Expreſſions, as well as in figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ones. And whoever doubted of it, or could doubt of it, who look'd upon him but as an ordinary Prophet, and not as one, who was alſo of the ſame Eſſence with the Father? But as the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is not, What Chriſt could do, but, What he hath done? So we find no reaſon to grant, but that our Saviour hath ſpoken plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough to thoſe, that are willing to underſtand him. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument goes on to alledge, that our Saviour was omniſcient, and as he could not therefore but know what Contentions would ariſe about this part of heavenly Doctrine to the certain deſtruction of Souls; So it is not at all likely that he would ſo far contribute to it, as of ſet purpoſe to wrap the true, and certain meaning of this holy My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery in the dark coverings of figurative words. But as I do not find any neceſſity to grant, that Chriſt was bound to do all he could, to prevent the Contentions that might afterwards happen, becauſe (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake<note n="(f)" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.19.</note> concerning <hi>Hereſies</hi>) this Good might accrue by them, that <hi>they that were approved, might</hi> thereby <hi>be made manifeſt;</hi> So I ſee as little reaſon to grant, that Chriſt did any way contribute to thoſe Contentions, or the ruine of Souls by them, by thoſe figurative Expreſſions, which he made uſe of in the preſent inſtance: Thoſe Coverings, wherein the Doctrine of the Sacrament is ſuppos'd to be wrap'd up, being not ſo thick, or obſcure, but that they may be ſeen through by Men of unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced Minds. I know not why it is added, unleſs it be to fill up the number of its forces, that our Saviour was near to death, when he inſtituted this Sacrament, and therefore no doubt well weighed before-hand what he ſpake concerning it. For who, but a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Heretick, ever thought, or ſaid, that our Saviour under any Circumſtances knew not what he ſpake? And therefore I ſhall only take notice of that, which concludes the preſent Argument, even that our Saviour was ſo far from giving any indication of other, than a literal interpretation, that, after he was advanced to Heave, he reveal'd the Doctrine of it in the ſame words, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was at firſt delivered. For not to ſay any thing at preſent to the latter part of this Allegation; Our Saviour (as was before ſhewn) gave ſufficient Indications of a figurative Interpretation, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the things given as his Body <hi>broken,</hi> and Blood <hi>ſhed,</hi> which they were not then nor can be now, and moreover willed his Diſciples to partake of what he gave them in <hi>remembrance</hi> of him, and of his death.</p>
                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:56517:173"/>
                     <p>A fourth Argument for the literal ſenſe of the words in queſtion, is the great Conformity there is between the ſeveral Hiſtorians of the Inſtitution, as to the words we are now upon; It being not to be thought, but that, if they had been to be taken in other, than a ſimple, and proper ſenſe, one, or other of thoſe holy Men would have added an Explication of them. But neither is there that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity between them as to the words, whereof we ſpeak, neither can it be ſaid, that none of thoſe Hiſtorians have given an Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them. For though, for inſtance, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in all of them, and we ſo far forth oblig'd to acknowledge a Conformity between them in their account of the preſent words; Yet St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> add to thoſe words, <hi>which is given for you,</hi> and <hi>which is broken for you,</hi> which are not only Additions, but (if what I have elſewhere ſaid<note n="(g)" place="margin">Part 5.</note> be well weigh'd) due Explications of them alſo, and ſuch as ſhew them not to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of that literal Interpretation, which they are ſo willing to put upon them. There is as little truth in what is added, that none of thoſe Hiſtorians have given any explication of them. For not to repeat what was but now ſaid concerning the words, <hi>which is given,</hi> or <hi>broken</hi> for you; St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> take care to remark, that our Saviour enjoin'd his Diſciples to eat what he gave them in <hi>remembrance</hi> of him, and of his Death, which is no obſcure Indication of thoſe words being to be figuratively un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</p>
                     <p>The fifth Argument for the literal Senſe, is the ſuppoſed Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the figurative; Which the better to evince, it is pretended that there is no place for any Figure either in the <hi>Subject, Predicate,</hi> or the <hi>Copula,</hi> that ties them together. And if there be no Figure in either of theſe, there is no Figure at all, and the Propoſitions therefore, that are compos'd of them, to be literally underſtood. Now as I have elſewhere<note n="(h)" place="margin">Part 3.</note> affirm'd the figurativeneſs of theſe Propoſitions to conſiſt in the word <hi>[Is],</hi> as which I have there ſhewn to be the ſame in ſenſe with <hi>ſignifies,</hi> and accordingly ſo us'd in Speeches of the like nature; So I ſhall therefore content my ſelf to return an Anſwer to what is objected as to the figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveneſs of that word, whether it be from <hi>Logick,</hi> or from the <hi>Scripture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now the firſt thing, that is objected from the former of theſe <hi>Heads,</hi> is, that the <hi>Copula</hi> or the word <hi>[Is]</hi> is no part of a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and others, and therefore the figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveneſs of the whole not to be placed in it. I will leave it to the Sophiſters to anſwer to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Authority, becauſe I think that Office is fitter for them, than for a Divine; It ſhall ſuffice me to make anſwer, that as a Man of good natural Underſtanding would take that to be a part of a Propoſition, without which in many Propoſitions the <hi>Subject,</hi> and <hi>Predicate</hi> could have no connexion, nor any more conſtitute a Propoſition, than Stone, and Timber, and other Materials do a Houſe, till they are united to one another, and compacted into a Building of that Shape, and uſe; So men, that have had a Name for this <hi>Art of Reaſoning,</hi> have been of a quite different opinion from the Objectors, and not only not look'd upon the word <hi>[Is]</hi> as no part of the Propoſition, but as the very <hi>Soul</hi>
                        <pb n="257" facs="tcp:56517:173"/>of it. For the <hi>Copula</hi> (ſaith <hi>Petrus à Sancto Joſeph</hi>
                        <note n="(i)" place="margin">Idea Phil. Ration. li. <hi>2.</hi> Art. <hi>4.</hi>
                        </note>) is to the <hi>Subject,</hi> and <hi>Predicate,</hi> as the <hi>Form</hi> is to the <hi>material</hi> parts of any thing, and gives them the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of a Propoſition; After the ſame manner as the <hi>formal</hi> part of a Houſe is not the Stones, and Timber of it, but that, by which they are connected. And <hi>Burgerſdicius,</hi> an Author better known, and as terrible a Man at the <hi>Art of Reaſoning,</hi> is not only of the ſame Mind with the former as to the word <hi>[Is]</hi> being part of a Propoſition, but tells us more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over<note n="(k)" place="margin">Inſtit. Log. li. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>27.</hi>
                        </note>, that it is a part of the <hi>Predicate,</hi> and indeed the very <hi>Form,</hi> and <hi>Soul</hi> of it. Which he proves by a thing, that is agreed on among the differing Parties, even that the word <hi>[Is],</hi> when inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in another <hi>Verb,</hi> is part of the <hi>Predicate.</hi> For if (ſaith he) the word <hi>[Is]</hi> when included in another <hi>Verb</hi> is part of the <hi>Predicate,</hi> why ſhall it not be a part of the <hi>Predicate,</hi> when it is ſet by it ſelf? Which, with the Inſtance, which he ſubjoins, and another Reaſon for it, I ſhall leave to the <hi>Logicians</hi> of the other ſide to anſwer. But beſide that more remote Objection of the <hi>Copula's</hi> being no part of a Propoſition, and therefore the figurativeneſs of the preſent ones not to be placed there; It is farther added, that this <hi>Copula,</hi> or the word <hi>[Is]</hi> is a word of no certain ſignification in it ſelf (For I forbear the mention of that hard Name, which the <hi>Logicians</hi> give it) whereas Tropes, and Figures can have place only in words of certain ſignification, becauſe altering them from their native ſignification to a foreign one. And it muſt be granted, that the word <hi>[Is]</hi> is ſo far forth of an uncertain ſignification, that it may, and is wont to be appli'd to ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Predications,</hi> and particularly to ſuch as are only <hi>accidental,</hi> as well as to thoſe that are <hi>eſſential.</hi> For thus we may, and do affirm, that <hi>Socrates,</hi> for inſtance, is of this, or that Colour, which denotes only an <hi>Accident,</hi> as well as that he is a reaſonable Creature, which points out the very <hi>Eſſence</hi> of him. But as the word <hi>[Is]</hi> hath this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſignification in the general, as to point to ſomewhat that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally belongs to the Subject, to which it relates, whether it be of the Eſſence, or only an Accident thereof; So it may ſo far forth be capable of being alter'd from its native ſignification to a foreign one, which is the thing this Argument was intended to impugne.</p>
                     <p>But leaving ſuch Niceties, as theſe, to ſuch as take more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in them, that ſo we may with more freedom apply our ſelves to the Conſideration of the Scriptures; Let us, as is no doubt more for our Profit, conſider what they alledge from thence to impugn the figurativeneſs of this ſo much controverted word <hi>[Is].</hi> Where the firſt thing, that occurrs, is, that in thoſe words, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the <hi>Cup,</hi> the word <hi>[Is]</hi> in the original <hi>Greek</hi> is wanting in St. <hi>Luke;</hi> For, whatever is pretended, it is not wanting in S. <hi>Paul,</hi> though it be out of its uſual order. And this, for ought I can ſee, is made one of thoſe potent Arguments, which confounded <hi>Piſcator,</hi> and cauſed him; after he had many years ſtoutly defended the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurativeneſs thereof; to retract his Opinion in that Particular. But as I ſee no ſuch force in this, or the other Arguments to occaſion any change of Opinion; So the word <hi>[Is]</hi> is ſo often underſtood, that St. <hi>Luke</hi> might, upon that account, take the leſs care to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:56517:174"/>it, eſpecially having before made uſe of it in the matter of the other Element. And I ſhall only add, that if there be any thing, which ſeems to preſs hard upon the ſuppoſed figurativeneſs of the word <hi>[Is],</hi> it muſt be that the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> for ought appears, hath no word to expreſs <hi>[Is]</hi> or <hi>Are,</hi> and our Saviour therefore, when he pronounc'd the preſent Propoſitions, to have uttered them without any word to anſwer to it, only mentioning, <hi>This my Body,</hi> and, <hi>This my Blood,</hi> as the Scripture ſpeaks in the like Caſes. Which ſuppos'd, one would think, the figurativeneſs of thoſe Propoſitions ſhould not be plac'd, where we have done it, and (becauſe there ſeems nothing elſe to place it in) to be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly baniſh'd from them. But as it is plain from the Evangeliſts tranſlating thoſe words, This <hi>is</hi> my Body, and, This <hi>is</hi> my Blood, that the word <hi>[Is],</hi> though not expreſs'd, yet was always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> So to ſuppoſe the contrary, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the literal Senſe, as well as the figurative, becauſe there can be no Senſe at all, unleſs it be either expreſſed, or underſtood. By the ſame Reaſon therefore that they, who advance the literal Senſe of thoſe Propoſitions, place that literal Senſe in the word <hi>[Is],</hi> though it be rather ſuppos'd, than expreſs'd; By the very ſame Reaſon may we place the figurativeneſs thereof in it, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret thoſe Propoſitions by it.</p>
                     <p>One only Argument remains, if yet it deſerve that Name, that the literal ſenſe is the only one, that can bring Men to a <hi>ſetledneſs</hi> in the Doctrine of the Euchariſt, or give us any good Aſſurance, when we come to appear before Chriſt's Judgment-Seat; They, who run after Tropes, and Figures, knowing not where to fix, as appears by the differences, that are between them, and much leſs likely to ſtand in the day of Temptation, or in that more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible day of the Lord Jeſus. But as it is now pretty evident, that they, who follow a figurative Senſe, are neither ſo uncertain in themſelves, nor ſo different from one another<note n="(l)" place="margin">Vid. Coſins. Hiſt. Tranſ. Papal. cap. <hi>2.</hi>
                        </note>, that any Man can with Reaſon reproach them upon that account; So they, who pretend to follow the literal Senſe, are ſo far from coming to any ſettledneſs in this Affair, that they cannot agree what that literal Senſe is, and ought not therefore to be more confident of their own future ſtanding at the day of Trial, than a ſincere pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of the Truth, and a belief they have it will be able to give them. Which, as it is not deni'd to them by us, ſo will, it is hoped, be as eaſily granted to us by them, when they conſider more calmly of our Opinions, and the grounds of them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But let us ſuppoſe that the words in controverſie were to be taken in the literal ſenſe, and whatever can be fairly deduc'd from thence to be the genuine iſſue of Chriſtianity; Yet how doth it appear that that, which we call <hi>Conſubſtantiation,</hi> and they, though improperly enough, a <hi>true, real,</hi> and <hi>ſubſtantial Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> of Chriſt's Body and Blood in the Sacrament, can receive any countenance from it? For not only do the <hi>Lutherans</hi> maintain a <hi>ſimple</hi> Preſence of them in the Euchariſt, but ſo <hi>intimate</hi> a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence alſo, that they, and the Sacramental Elements make up one <hi>compound;</hi> By means whereof, as the Perſon of Chriſt by the union of his Divine and Humane Nature may be ſaid to be either God,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:56517:174"/>or Man, ſo that, which is made up of the Sacramental Element, and the thing of the Sacrament may by that union of theirs be in like manner affirm'd to be either the one, or the other, without any kind of impropriety, or figure. Conſequently whereto, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour call'd this <hi>Compound thing</hi> by the Name of his <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> ſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> might as well give it the Title of <hi>Bread,</hi> or <hi>Wine,</hi> where he ſpeaks ſo often of its being <hi>eaten,</hi> or <hi>drunken</hi> by both the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and unworthy partakers of it. Now what is there in the letter of the words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and, <hi>This is my Blood,</hi> to found ſuch a Doctrine on? What is there in them, that they themſelves can think of any moment to inferr it? Nothing, for ought that I can diſcern, but the Neuter <gap reason="foreign">

For as for whatever elſe they advance upon this Head, it is either founded upon this ſuppoſed Union, or tends only to ſhew that there is a real, and ſubſtantial Preſence of Chriſt's Body, and Blood in the Sacrament, and which, becauſe I have already ſufficiently conſider'd, I think it not worth the while to ſpeak again unto.

What is the foundation of this relation, on the part of the former, the ſubject of the preſent Enquiry, and his pronouncing the words, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> and, <hi>Hic eſt calix,</hi> &amp;c. ſhewn not to be it, from the inſufficiency of thoſe grounds, on which it is built. What is urg'd in the behalf of thoſe words more particularly conſidered, and evidence made, that as there wants not in the Prayers, and Praiſes of the Communion-Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that which may tend to the founding of this Relation, ſo that the words, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> &amp;c. neither now have, nor, when Chriſt himſelf uſed them, had in them the power of produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it.

                     </argument>
                     <p n="4">

                     </p>
                     <p>Now though that hath in a great meaſure been ſatisfied already, and ſo may ſeem leſs neceſſary to be conſider'd a ſecond time; Yet becauſe what I have ſaid upon it lies diſperſedly in ſeveral Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, and will therefore require more pains to put it together than will be fit for me to impoſe upon my Reader; And becauſe too many things may, and muſt be added to it, to give the World a more diſtinct knowledge of this Affair; I ſhall (though ſo much the more briefly) repeat what hath been elſewhere ſaid, and add farther light, and ſtrength to it.</p>
                     <p>In the general I obſerve from what I have elſewhere<note n="*" place="margin">Expl. of the Sacr. in Gen. Part 2, 3.</note> diſcours'd, that the Foundation of that relation, which is between the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and inward part of the preſent Sacrament, is the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, not as delivered by him (For ſo it hath no more influence upon the Bread, and Wine of the Lord's Supper, than upon thoſe of our ordinary Repaſts) but as applied to thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Elements, that are to put on the relation of a Sacrament. I obſerve farther, that the Inſtitution of Chriſt conſiſting of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and Promiſes, to make it effectual to the producing of this Sacramental relation in the Elements, it muſt be applied to them by a due obſervation of thoſe Commands, and by a like Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its Promiſes. The Conſequent whereof will be, thirdly, that it muſt be applied to them on the one hand by the Stewards of this Myſtery, as to whom belongs the execution of its Commands, and, on the other, by Chriſt himſelf, as to whom alone belongs the Completion of the other. That though that application, which is to be made by Chriſt, is no doubt of the moſt Efficacy toward the producing of this Sacramental Relation, and, in ſtrictneſs of ſpeech, the only one, which can make thoſe Elements the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt's Body, and Blood; Yet that that application, which is to be made by the Stewards of this Myſtery, is in order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture before it, neither can Men expect that Chriſt ſhould convert thoſe Elements into a Sacrament, unleſs what he enjoins concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them be firſt obſerved by the other. I obſerve laſtly, that when queſtion is made in this particular, what is the <hi>Foundation</hi> of this Sacramental Relation, or (that I may ſpeak more agreeably to the Language of the Church) what that is, which <hi>conſecrates</hi>
                        <pb n="263" facs="tcp:56517:176"/>the Sacramental Elements; The meaning thereof is, what is the Foundation of that relation, on the part of the Stewards of this Myſtery, and what is requir'd of them to diſpoſe Chriſt to perform his part in this Affair, and cauſe thoſe Elements, which in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are no way fitted for it, to become to all intents and purpoſes, the Sacrament of Chriſt's Body and Blood.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> as is very well known, make the words, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> &amp;c. to be the words of Conſecration, and that it is to them, and them only, that this great relation is owing, and (which is more) a ſubſtantial change of the Elements into the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Body, and Blood of Chriſt. For though the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> is no way clear in this particular, as may appear to any, that ſhall take the pains to conſult it<note n="†" place="margin">Seſſ. <hi>13.</hi> cap. <hi>1.</hi>
                        </note>; Yet as it is the general opinion of their Writers, and the only one, that can ſafely be maintain'd among them, ſo it is that, which the <hi>Roman Miſſal</hi> doth ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently confirm: Becauſe entitling thoſe words, and thoſe alone, the words of Conſecration. A man would willingly ſee ſomething like a Reaſon for this Aſſertion, that ſo he might return ſomething like an Anſwer to it.

                        </note>, you ſhall find no other than this, that <hi>in the other parts of this Service there is only Praiſe given to God, or Prayer made unto him; But when this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament comes to be made, the Prieſt doth not then uſe his own words, but the words of Chriſt himſelf, therefore the word of Chriſt</hi> [even Hoc eſt corpus meum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] <hi>makes this Sacrament.</hi> I ſay nothing at this time that this Argument, ſuch as it is, is drawn from the Service of the Church, and not (as one would have thought, and had been but reaſonable) from the words of the Inſtitution, or from ſome other words of our bleſſed Saviour, and his Apoſtles. But I ſay, which will be enough, that let the Service of the Church be as legitimate as may be, yet there is nothing in it to perſwade what is endeavour'd to be inferred from it. For what, though in the other parts of the Service, there is nothing but <hi>Praiſe</hi> given to God (including therein, as I ſuppoſe, the <hi>giving of Thanks</hi>) and <hi>Prayer</hi> to God? Yet how will it thence follow, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it tending to the Conſecration of the Elements? For it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s making uſe of the word <hi>gave Thanks,</hi> for what the other Evangeliſts expreſs by <hi>bleſſed,</hi> that our Saviour <hi>bleſſed</hi> by <hi>giving Thanks.</hi> And why might not <hi>he</hi> then, or <hi>we</hi> now bleſs the Sacramental Elements in like manner, and by that bleſſing change them into a Sacrament, which is as much as to ſay, <hi>Conſecrate?</hi> And it appears alſo, that as little as the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> ſeem to eſteem of Prayer in this particular; Yet as there is even in their own <hi>Miſſal</hi> a Prayer to God, that <hi>he would vouchſafe to make their Oblation a bleſſed One,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that it might become to them the Body, and Blood of his Son,</hi> So Prayer it ſelf, ſo far as Man is capable of <hi>bleſſing,</hi> is no contemptible one, yea ſuch a Bleſſing, as God himſelf thought no improper one for a Prieſt, or rather<note n="(c)" place="margin">Num. 6.23. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> for the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> himſelf. But it may be, there is more in what they alledge, that <hi>when this Sacrament comes</hi> to be <hi>made</hi> (For ſtill they will take that for granted) <hi>the Prieſt doth not then uſe his own words, but the words of Chriſt himſelf;</hi> The <hi>Prieſt</hi>
                        <pb n="264" facs="tcp:56517:177"/>(as <hi>Aquinas</hi> afterwards<note n="(d)" place="margin">
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi ſupra.</note> tells us) <hi>ſpeaking as it were in the Perſon of Chriſt, to let us underſtand, that in the perfection of this Sacrament he doth nothing but pronounce the words of Chriſt.</hi> But firſt, if the Prieſt's uſing not his own words, but the words of Chriſt, be that, which makes what he ſaith, to have the force of Conſecration; How comes it to paſs, that his uſing the words, <hi>Accipite, &amp; manducate,</hi> which are as certainly the words of our Saviour, comes to have no part in it? Eſpecially, when <hi>Hoc eſt enim corpus meum</hi> (for ſo they expreſs it in their <hi>Miſſal</hi>) do ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly referr to the former, and are as manifeſtly a Reaſon of what is exhorted to in them. I ſay ſecondly, that though it be true, that the Prieſt doth not then uſe his own words, but thoſe of Chriſt himſelf; Yet he doth not uſe them as one ſpeaking in the Perſon of Chriſt, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> would inſinuate, but as a bare reciter of them, and a reciter of them too as ſpoken the Night before he ſuffer'd, and with reſpect to that particular Euchariſt, which he gave to his Diſciples. Which how it ſhould convert the Elements then before him into the Body, and Blood of Chriſt, is a thing as hard to be underſtood, as that converſion it ſelf; Words being in reaſon to be conſtrued with relation to that, and that alone, to which they are applied by the Author of them. Neither will it avail to ſay, that though the words conſidered in themſelves reſpect only that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Euchariſt, which our Saviour gave to his Diſciples, yet as applied by the Prieſt to the Elements, that are before him, they may affect them alſo. For if they are any otherwiſe applied to them, than to ſhew what our Saviour intended this Sacrament for, and conſequently what we may expect in thoſe Elements, which we ſet apart for it, if we follow his directions in the Conſecration of them; They are no more the words of our Saviour Chriſt, but of the Prieſt, who ſo applies them, and from which therefore no ſuch effect can be expected.</p>
                     <p>This I take to be a ſufficient Bar againſt placing the Power of Conſecration in thoſe words, yea though, when uttered by our Saviour, they ſhould be thought to have had that force in them. How much more, if even ſo they were rather declarations from Chriſt of what the Elements were already become, than any way productive of a Sacramental relation in them? For neither could our Saviour have truly ſaid, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> unleſs at that inſtant, when he ſpake thoſe words, it were really ſuch; And much leſs could that have been any reaſon, why he ſhould exhort them to take, and eat what he then offer'd them, as both the tenour of the words, and the <hi>Hoc eſt enim corpus meum</hi> in the <hi>Roman Miſſal</hi> doth yet more plainly declare: Becauſe if the words, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> make the change, it muſt have been Bread, and not his Body, which our Saviour offer'd his Diſciples before he uttered them, and willed them to take, and eat of.</p>
                     <p>But not any longer to inſiſt upon the deſtruction of that ſort of <hi>Conſecration,</hi> Let us enquire, if it may be, after a more legitimate one, and ſuch as ſhall not only be free from the like Exceptions, but better anſwer thoſe Sacramental relations, which it is to give birth unto. In order whereunto, I will conſider the Sacramental Elements firſt, as being to become a <hi>Sign</hi> of Chriſt's Body and
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:56517:177"/>Blood, and then as alſo a <hi>Means to communicate</hi> that Body, and Blood to us, and a <hi>Pledge</hi> to aſſure us thereof.</p>
                     <p>If we conſider the Sacramental Elements as being to become a <hi>Sign</hi> of Chriſt's crucified Body, and Blood, and accordingly to repreſent them both to our own Minds, and thoſe of others; So it cannot but be thought neceſſary to declare, whether by the words of the Inſtitution, or others, for what purpoſes they are deſign'd, and what they were intended to repreſent. For thoſe Elements<note n="(e)" place="margin">Expl. of the Sacr. in Gen. Part 2.</note> being not ſo clear a repreſentation of the things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by them, as by their own force to ſuggeſt them to the Minds of thoſe, for whom they were intended; Being much leſs ſo clear a repreſentation of them, as to invite thoſe to reflect upon them, who are either ſlow of underſtanding, or otherwiſe indiſpoſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template them, ſuch as are the generality of Men; It cannot but be thought neceſſary, even upon that account, to call in the aſſiſtance of ſuch words, as may declare to thoſe, that are concern'd, for what ends, and purpoſes they were appointed. Otherwiſe Men may either look upon the whole of that Sacrament as a purely <hi>civil</hi> Action, or (if the Perſon, that adminiſtreth it, and other ſuch like Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances prompt them to conceive of it as a <hi>religious</hi> one) yet fancy to themſelves ſuch ends, and purpoſes, as are either different from, or contrary to the due intendment of it. And though it be true, that in that Euchariſt, which our Saviour celebrated with his Diſciples, there appears no ſuch declaration of the ends of Chriſt in it, till he comes to admoniſh them to take what he gave as his Body, and Blood, which ſuppoſeth them to have been made ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; Yet as it is clear from thence, that he thought ſuch a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to be neceſſary to manifeſt his ends in it, ſo it is no way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, but rather highly probable, that he interlaid that Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, and Prayer, wherewith he is ſaid to have bleſs'd the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this Sacrament, with a declaration of thoſe ends, for which they were deſigned by him: It appearing not otherwiſe how that Thankſgiving, and Prayer, could have fitted the matter in hand, or ſtirred up the Minds of his Diſciples to intend it with that devotion, which the importance thereof requir'd.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide, if we conſider the Sacramental Elements as being to become a <hi>Means of communicating</hi> that Body, and Blood to us, and, which is but conſequent thereto, a <hi>Pledge to aſſure us thereof;</hi> So it is as little to be doubted, but that it muſt be brought about by <hi>Thankſgiving to God,</hi> on the one hand, for giving him to die, whoſe crucified Body, and Blood this Sacrament was intended to convey; and by <hi>Prayer</hi> to him, on the other, to make thoſe Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments become the <hi>Communion</hi> of them: The former, becauſe Thankſgiving appears to have been the Means by which our Saviour bleſſed them, and moreover, the principal deſign of this Sacrament toward God, and which therefore unleſs we comply with, we cannot reaſonably hope for the Benefits of; The latter, becauſe (as hath been elſewhere ſhewn) Prayer was a part of that Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and becauſe it is undoubtedly the general Means appointed by Chriſt for the obtaining of all Benefits whatſoever. Which things, how momentous ſoever, I have thus lightly paſſed over, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have ſpoken to them ſufficiently elſewhere, and particularly,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:56517:178"/>where I intreated of the Inſtitution of this Sacrament, and of that Thankſgiving, by which our Saviour is affirmed to have bleſs'd it.</p>
                     <p>That, which in my opinion ought more eſpecially to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, is the uſefulneſs of the former Reſolution to compromiſe thoſe Quarrels, which have for ſome time been raiſed in this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For whilſt ſome contend earneſtly for Conſecration by Thankſgiving, and Prayer, as they have reaſon enough to do upon the account of our Saviour's being affirmed to conſecrate by it, and of <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Origen,</hi> and ſeveral others repreſenting the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this Sacrament, as becoming what they were intended by the force of thoſe Thankſgivings, and Prayers, which were made over them; And whilſt others again contend as earneſtly, that they are made ſuch by the <hi>words</hi> of the Inſtitution, and alledge with the ſame heat <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his affirming<note n="(f)" place="margin">Adv. hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſ. li. <hi>5.</hi> cap. <hi>2.</hi>

For it is the word of the Inſtitution applied, as that Inſtitution directs, which conſecrates the Elements into thoſe ſeveral relations, which they aſſume. And it is the ſame word of Inſtitution declar'd, which contributes more particularly to the making of thoſe Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments become a Sign of Chriſt's Body, and Blood. But then as it is appli'd by Thankſgiving, and Prayer (becauſe they are a part of its Commands) as well as by a declaration of the whole; So that Thankſgiving, and Prayer contribute to thoſe relations, which do moſt ennoble them, even thoſe, by which the Elements be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the <hi>Communion</hi> of Chriſt's Body, and Blood, and a <hi>Pledge</hi> to aſſure us thereof: Not by any force, which is in the Letters, and Syllables thereof, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> makes <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> and <hi>Hic eſt Calix ſanguinis mei</hi> to do, but by the force of that Inſtitution, which preſcribes them, and by their natural aptitude to diſpoſe God, to whom alone ſuch great Effects are to be aſcrib'd, to give the Elements of this Sacrament thoſe moſt excellent relations, and efficacy.</p>

                        </note>, which they return to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Arguments, and particularly with what they anſwer to what is urg'd from the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of Chriſt. Where they tell us in the firſt place, that though Chriſt brake the Bread, and may ſo far forth perhaps be thought to preſcribe the like to thoſe, that were to adminiſter the Sacrament after him; Yet it was rather in order to the diſtribution of it (the Bread then us'd requiring him ſo to do) than to repreſent the breaking of his own Body. But beſide that what they affirm in the former part of it is ſaid without any other proof, than that the Bread then us'd requir'd breaking, in order to the diſtribution of it (For, as to any thing they advance to the contrary, Chriſt might break the Bread for repreſentation, as well as for diſtribution) St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſaid enough to ſhew, that Chriſt brake the Bread of this Sacrament to repreſent the ill uſage of his Body; There being not any tolerable reaſon, why St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould, in the very Hiſtory of the Inſtitution, attribute ſo improper a term as that of breaking to Chriſt's Body, but that the breaking of the Bread, which was a Figure of it, was intended to denote that violence, which was offer'd to his crucified one. That An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer not ſucceeding, they flie unto another, and tell us that the words, <hi>Do this,</hi> referr principally to what the Apoſtles were to do in the preſent Action, amongſt which the breaking of Bread being not then to be, becauſe the Bread was before broken to their hands, the Command of, <hi>Do this,</hi> is not to be thought to extend properly, and principally to the breaking of the Bread, but to the taking, and eating of it. It is a ſtrange thing to ſee how Prejudice will caſt a miſt before wiſe Mens Eyes, and prompt them to ſay that for the defence of their Opinions in one thing, which will do them as much miſchief in another. For the very ſame Argument, <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> will ſerve alike to overthrow that <hi>bleſſing</hi> of the Bread, which they, as well as we, think themſelves obliged to maintain, as without which indeed it can be no part of the preſent Sacrament. For if the words, <hi>Do this,</hi> are to be thought to extend no farther, than to what the Apoſtles were to do in that Sacrament, which they celebrated with our Saviour, then are they of as little force to conclude the bleſſing of the Bread before we eat it, becauſe the Bread was at that time, as much bleſſed to their hands, as it is affirmed to have been broken to them. But beſide that that Anſwer is as much of force againſt themſelves in the bleſſing of the Bread, as it can be ſuppos'd to be againſt us in the breaking of it; It hath nothing in it, which can conclude againſt the force of thoſe words, from which the breaking of the Bread is inferred. For whether principally, or leſs principally, if the words, <hi>Do this,</hi> referr'd to
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:56517:180"/>ſomewhat elſe, than what the Apoſtles were then to do, then might they referr alſo to the breaking of the Bread, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the breaking of the Bread be inferred from them, as well as the eating of it. And indeed as he, who ſuggeſts this Anſwer, lays the neceſſity of bleſſing the Bread<note n="†" place="margin">Gerhard ubi ſupra. cap. <hi>13.</hi> Sect. <hi>149.</hi>
                        </note> in Chriſt's commanding us to <hi>do</hi> the ſame thing, which he did, which if he did in any words of the Inſtitution, it was in the preſent ones, and thereby ſhews them to extend to ſomewhat elſe beſide eating; So if they relate to ſucceeding Sacraments, as well as to what our Saviour celebrated with his Diſciples, as is evident from his adding <hi>in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me,</hi> they muſt conſequently relate to all that, which was neceſſary to make the Bread, which he enjoyned us to eat, to become the Sacrament of his Body, becauſe the Bread, which he commanded his Diſciples to eat, was repreſented by him as ſuch. From whence as it will follow, that ſomewhat elſe was referr'd to by the words, <hi>Do this,</hi> than that eating, which was juſt before enjoin'd upon the Diſciples, even that Bleſſing, or Thankſgiving, which Chriſt is ſaid to have premis'd to this whole Action; So it is but juſt to believe, that that <hi>breaking</hi> alſo was, which followed imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon it, and which appears from what hath been ſaid to repreſent the breaking of that Body, which the Bread they were commanded to eat, was intended as a Repreſentation of. I ſay thirdly, and laſtly, that how confidently ſoever it is affirm'd, that the words, <hi>Do this,</hi> relate principally to the eating next before en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd, yet is there no reaſon to believe, that it related more to eating, than to any of the foregoing Actions, otherwiſe than as that eating was the <hi>Complement</hi> of the whole, and conſequently preſuppos'd all the former Actions to have been perform'd. Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe if eating in it ſelf conſider'd, had been the principal thing deſign'd, the repetition of the ſame word <hi>eat</hi> would have better fitted the end of the Speaker; And partly, becauſe, ſetting aſide thoſe general words, <hi>Do this,</hi> there would have been nothing in the Inſtitution to expreſs with any clearneſs that Bleſſing, and diſtribution of the Bread, which they, as well as we, think to be enjoin'd upon us in the adminiſtration of this Sacrament. One other Anſwer they have, if it be lawful ſo to call it, that if we will argue from what Chriſt did in this particular, to what we our ſelves are to do, we muſt either ſhew that action to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe neceſſary, or find our ſelves oblig'd to celebrate this Holy Sacrament in the like poſture, and time, and place, wherein we read our Saviour to have done it. But beſide that we do not argue ſimply from what our Saviour did in this particular, but from that Action of his being plac'd between two, that are confeſſed to be intended by the words, <hi>Do this,</hi> and ſo in all reaſon to be look'd upon as alike enjoined by them; We cannot but think that it hath farther evidence for the neceſſity of it from its ſo well repreſenting that ill uſage, which our Saviour's Body receiv'd, that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he came to ſpeak of that uſage of it as a thing commemorated in this Sacrament, expreſſed it by the <hi>breaking</hi> of it.</p>
                     <p>The Argument from the Inſtitution being thus ſecur'd, and vindicated from the Exceptions of its Adverſaries, we ſhall the leſs need to concern our ſelves about what the <hi>Lutherans</hi> anſwer to
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:56517:180"/>thoſe, that follow, as which we our ſelves make uſe of rather to ſtrengthen our Aſſertion, than that we think them of themſelves to be a juſt foundation of it. Only that it may appear, that even they are not without their weight, I ſhall, though very briefly, reply to what is anſwer'd to them.</p>
                     <p>Now as that, which the <hi>Lutherans</hi> anſwer upon all occaſions; is, that that breaking, which was made uſe of by our Saviour, and his Apoſtles, was rather for the better diſtribution of the Bread they us'd, than for any ſignificancy in it; So when we preſs them with the <hi>Jews</hi> breaking their <hi>Euchariſtical</hi> Bread, which in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity gave occaſion to the Inſtitution of ours, they tell us, that as the Bread, which the <hi>Jews</hi> made uſe of, was more eaſie to be broken than ours, as being made not ſo thick as ours now is, but broader, and thinner, and indeed rather like Cakes, than Loaves; ſo the only end of that breaking was to diſtribute the Bread they us'd among thoſe, that were to partake of it. But as whatever is to be ſaid concerning the uſual Bread of the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet if I can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the account, that is given by <hi>Caſſander</hi> out of <hi>Paulus Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> (For I have not <hi>Fagius</hi> his diſcourſe upon this Argument to conſult) the Bread the <hi>Jews</hi> both heretofore, and now make uſe of in their Euchariſt, was caſt into ſo thick a maſs, that it could not well be broken in pieces; ſo this Ceremony of breaking was, and is ſo religiouſly obſerv'd in the preſent inſtance, that though they almoſt cut off from the whole that part, which they are to make uſe of, yet they leave ſo much of it uncut, as may ſerve ſtill for the breaking of it, which ſhews that there was ſomewhat elſe in it.</p>
                     <p>The next thing alledg'd by us to ſtrengthen the preſent Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is this Sacrament's being deſcrib'd both in the Scripture, and the Antients by the Name of <hi>breaking of Bread,</hi> which we ſuppoſe it would hardly have been, if that had not been accounted a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Action in it, and much leſs, if it had been accounted ſo indifferent a one, as the <hi>Lutherans</hi> are willing to have it thought. But as, where they can, they endeavour to turn thoſe Expreſſions to another ſenſe, but with how little reaſon the places before quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note n="(a)" place="margin">Part 2.</note> will ſhew; So the burthen of their Song always is, that the breaking there mention'd, had no other deſign, than the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of the Bread among thoſe, that were to receive it, which few impartial Men will believe, who find St. <hi>Paul</hi> repreſenting the Bread which our Saviour brake, as that Body, which was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for his Diſciples.</p>
                     <p>I find nothing of moment return'd to what is before alledged by us concerning St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s intimating the Bread, which we <hi>break,</hi> to be as much the <hi>Communion</hi> of Chriſt's Body, as the Cup of Bleſſing, which we <hi>bleſs,</hi> is the <hi>Communion</hi> of his Blood. And therefore I ſhall only add, that though I do not pretend to inferr from thence, that the <hi>breaking of the Bread</hi> ought to be rank'd in the ſame order with the <hi>bleſſing of the Cup;</hi> Yet I can hardly think, that if St. <hi>Paul</hi> had thought it ſo inconſiderable a thing as the <hi>Lutherans</hi> ſeem to do, he would have made uſe of no other Epithet, than that of <hi>broken</hi> to denote that <hi>Bread,</hi> which he intimated to be as much the <hi>Communion</hi> of Chriſt's Body, as the Cup that is <hi>bleſs'd,</hi> is the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:56517:181"/>
                        <hi>Commnnion</hi> of the other. For to make the words <hi>which we break</hi> to ſignifie no other, than what we give, or diſtribute (which is the common Anſwer to all Difficulties) is without any foundation in the preſent place; Becauſe what St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms of the Cup relates to that, which makes it to be a Sacramental one, and not to the delivery of it to thoſe, that are to partake of it.</p>
                     <p>But it may be their Arguments are better than their Anſwers, and ſo they had need to be to give any ſtrength to their Opinions. But whoſoever ſhall take the pains to conſider them, or indeed, but to look over them, will ſoon be convinced of the contrary. For to ſay nothing at all to what they alledge concerning this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony of <hi>breaking</hi> being without any divine Command, becauſe the contrary thereof hath been ſhewn already; How abſurd is it to ſay, that it is repugnant to the nature of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> to have any thing in it to repreſent another, when not only the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Baptiſm, and their cleanſing quality are a manifeſt Image of a better Purification, but the <hi>plunging the baptized Party</hi> in them, and his <hi>riſing</hi> from thence was thought to be ſo clear a one of our being <hi>buried,</hi> and <hi>riſing</hi> after a ſpiritual manner, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribes the former by being <hi>buried with him by Baptiſm into death</hi>
                        <note n="(b)" place="margin">Rom. 6.4.</note>, and by being <hi>planted together in the likeneſs</hi>
                        <note n="(c)" place="margin">Rom. 6.5.</note> of it? But it may be there is more reaſon in that which it follows, even that the <hi>breaking</hi> of the Bread cannot be thought to be a repreſentation of <hi>that</hi> in the <hi>Body</hi> of Chriſt, which is expreſly denied of it; For ſo they think that <hi>breaking</hi> to be, where it is ſaid<note n="(d)" place="margin">Joh. 19.26.</note> that <hi>they brake not his Legs,</hi> according to a <hi>Prophecy</hi>
                        <note n="(e)" place="margin">Pſal. 34.10.</note>, that went of old con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him. But as they ought to have remembred that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> notwithſtanding that, affirms Chriſt's Body to have been <hi>broken,</hi> and in that very place alſo where he ſpeaks of the <hi>breaking</hi> of the Sign of it, which ſhews that he thought all <hi>breaking</hi> of Chriſt's Body not to be deni'd; There is no neceſſity that that, which is intended to be repreſented, ſhould ſtrictly, and literally anſwer what was deſign'd as a repreſentation of it. Otherwiſe the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> things of the <hi>New</hi> Teſtament will hardly paſs as things repreſented by the <hi>ſenſible</hi> ones of the <hi>Old</hi> Teſtament, which yet theſe <hi>latter</hi> being affirm'd to be <hi>Figures</hi>
                        <note n="(f)" place="margin">Heb. 9.24.</note> of the <hi>former</hi> will oblige us to believe. It is enough in things, that are of a very different nature, that there is ſome general reſemblance between them, and ſuch as that difference, which is between them, will allow. Which ſuppos'd, there may be enough in our Saviour's <hi>Body,</hi> though not capable of a ſtrict, and proper breaking, to anſwer that breaking, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> attributes to it, and the breaking of that Bread, which was deſigned to repreſent it; Our Saviour's Body having had thus much of a <hi>breaking</hi> in it, that an equal violence was offer'd to it, and the continuity thereof diſſolv'd in ſeveral parts of it by thoſe Nails, and Spear, that pierced it. The ſame perſons go on to object, that if the breaking of the Bread be neceſſary to deſign the breaking of Chriſt's Body, the pouring out of the Wine will be as neceſſary to mark out the ſhedding of his Blood. Which latter being not to be pretended, becauſe of the ſilence there is of it in the Inſtitution, the former hath as little reaſon to be believ'd, or aſſerted. But as it appears from what hath been elſewhere ſaid<note n="(g)" place="margin">Part 4.</note>, that there are
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:56517:181"/>very fair intimations of that pouring out of the Wine, which is here ſo expreſly deni'd, and the ſignificancy of the breaking of the Bread not to be deni'd upon that account; So the Argument al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd againſt the neceſſity thereof proceeds upon the ſuppoſition of our thinking it to be neceſſary in it ſelf, and ſo, that the Sacrament cannot be ſalv'd without it. Whereas all, that we pretend to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, is its being neceſſary by a Divine Precept, and otherwiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient enough to mark out that violent uſage of him upon the Croſs, which the whole Sacrament was confeſſedly intended for a Memorial of. Both which things may be affirm'd without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring any neceſſity of the pouring out of the Wine, or of our Saviour's giving Command concerning it. For if even the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Bread, abſtracting from the Command of Chriſt, be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther convenient, than neceſſary, the pouring out of the Wine can be no more than ſuch; And if neither of them be neceſſary, Chriſt may, no doubt, command one, and not the other, and what he hath therefore ſaid concerning the breaking of the Bread of no force to conclude, that there ought to be the like Command for the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the other Element. It is objected yet again (For what is wanting in ſtrength, men commonly endeavour to make up by the number of their forces) it is objected, I ſay, that if Chriſt ſhould have inſtituted this Sacrament to repreſent the breaking of his Body, and the ſhedding of his Blood, by the breaking, or pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of thoſe Elements, that were intended to repreſent them, he ſhould have made choice of a more obſcure Figure to come in the place of a clearer one, which is not to be ſuppoſed of him: There being no doubt, but the killing of the <hi>Paſchal</hi> Lamb, was a more lively Image of what was done unto our Saviour, than what is done to the Elements of this Sacrament. But as it becomes not us to diſpute what was moſt proper for God, or Chriſt to do, where they have at any time declar'd their own will and pleaſure; So Chriſt might have reaſon enough to preferr the Repreſentation he here made uſe of, though perhaps not ſo clear, before that which he made choice of among the <hi>Jews:</hi> As becauſe that People, by reaſon of the groſsneſs of their Underſtandings, ſtood in need of clearer Figures, than we our ſelves do, to inſinuate into their Minds the things intended by them; So becauſe whilſt he taught them upon the matter only by Types, and Figures, he teacheth us for the moſt part by plain Declarations, and from which therefore, if there be any need of it, we may eaſily collect what is the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the other. It is objected laſtly (For ſo low at length do their Arguments run) that our Doctrine concerning the myſtical ſignification of the breaking of the Bread ſavours of <hi>Popery,</hi> and miniſters to <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> though how it ſhould do both, conſidering the contrariety of thoſe two Hypotheſes, is not ſo eaſie to apprehend. But as I ſee not how that Doctrine ſavours at all of <hi>Popery,</hi> becauſe the ſignification we give to the breaking of the Bread is of a quite different nature from what the Papiſts ſuggeſt, and indeed no other than the Inſtitution it ſelf offers to us (For we, no more than the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> believe that the Hoſt ought to be broken into juſt three parts, or for the reaſons, that are given by them for it) ſo I ſee as little, how our Doctrine miniſters to <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> even in the point,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:56517:182"/>that is now before us; Becauſe though we declare the breaking of the Bread to have been intended for a repreſentation of our Saviour's crucified Body, yet we do not believe, as they do, that that was the ſole intendment of that, and other the uſances of the preſent Sacrament, but that as Chriſt meant we ſhould ſhew forth by them what he ſuffered in his Body, ſo we ſhould alſo thereby be made partakers of it, and of the Benefits thereof.</p>

                        </note>, or rather Chriſt himſelf under the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Bread, and Wine; That the Offering, which is made of it, is no ſimple tender of it to the Father, but the offering of it up by way of a Sacrifice, and accordingly he himſelf ſacrificed, or ſlain in it, but after an unbloody manner; That this Sacrifice is not only an Euchariſtical, or Commemorative Sacrifice, but a truly propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory one for quick, and dead, and by which God is ſo far appeas'd, as to grant Pardon, and Grace to the one, and a <hi>Refrigerium</hi> to the other.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. How well theſe things agree either with one another, or with that Sacrifice, which Chriſt made of himſelf upon the Croſs, ſhall then be conſidered, when I come to oppoſe proper Arguments to it. My preſent Buſineſs ſhall be to examine the Grounds, upon which it is built, and ſhew the vanity thereof. Where again I will inſiſt upon no other Grounds, than what the ſame Council of <hi>Trent</hi> offers for it, and which therefore thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion muſt think themſelves obliged either to ſtand, or fall by.</p>
                     <p>Now that, which the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> principally founds it ſelf upon in this Affair, is on the one hand the converſion of the Bread, and Wine of the Sacrament into the Body, and Blood of Chriſt, as without which there could be no Pretence for the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them up under the <hi>Species</hi> of the other; And, on the other hand, thoſe known words of Chriſt to his Apoſtles, and their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me:</hi> Theſe words, as that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil tells us, having been always underſtood and declar'd by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church as a Command of Chriſt to them, to offer up his Body, and Blood. But as enough hath been ſaid already<note n="(i)" place="margin">Part 7.</note> to
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:56517:182"/>ſhew the unſoundneſs of the former of theſe grounds, and that therefore no juſt foundation of the offering of Chriſt's Body; and Blood in the preſent Sacrament; So we ſhall find there is as little ſolidity in that ſuppoſed Command of Chriſt to his Apoſtles, and their Succeſſors in the words, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> For neither can thoſe words be fairly drawn to ſignifie the offering up of Chriſt's Body, and Blood, neither doth it appear, whatever is pretended, that the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church hath had that underſtanding of them. That the words themſelves cannot be fairly drawn to ſignifie the offering up of Chriſt's Body, and Blood, will appear if we conſider them either as referring to the ſeveral things before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, and particularly to what he himſelf had done, or enjoined them to do, or as referring only to that Body and Blood, which immediately precede them, and in which ſenſe they are ſuppos'd to ſignifie the ſacrificing, or offering of them. If we conſider the words, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> as referring to the ſeveral things before ſpoken of, even thoſe, which Chriſt himſelf had done, or enjoined them to do; So there is no appearance of their being a Command to the Apoſtles, or their Succeſſors to offer up his Body, and Blood, unleſs there had been any precedent mention of Chriſt's offering them up himſelf, or any kind of intimation of his enjoining them to do it. The latter of which two, as it is not to by affirm'd by thoſe, who make the words, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> to be thoſe, which conſtituted both the Sacrifice, and the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers of it; So I ſee as little reaſon for the affirming of the <hi>former,</hi> how confidently ſoever the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> advanceth it. For what mention can we expect, for inſtance, of Chriſt's offering up his Body under the Species of Bread, when till he had ſpoken the words, <hi>This is my Body</hi> (which was not, till he had done all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to that Element) there was no ſuch thing under the Species of Bread for Chriſt to offer up, becauſe not to be, till thoſe words had paſs'd upon it. But it may be, there is more force in the words, <hi>Do this,</hi> as referring to that <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately precede them, in which ſenſe they are ſuppos'd to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the <hi>ſacrificing</hi> or <hi>offering</hi> of them. And ſo no doubt there is, or they will be found to have little force in them. But what if we ſhould ſay firſt, that there is as little appearance of their referring to the words, <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> as what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſubjoineth to them, and the very <hi>Canon</hi> of the Maſs perſwades? For St. <hi>Paul</hi> inferring upon thoſe words, that <hi>as oft as they ate that Bread, and drank that Cup, they did ſhew forth the Lord's death till he came;</hi> And again, that <hi>whoſoever ſhould eat that Bread, and drink that Cup of the Lord unworthily, ſhould be guilty of the Body, and Blood of the Lord,</hi> He doth not obſcurely intimate, that when our Saviour ſaid with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to each Element, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> his meaning was, that they ſhould do what he had before enjoin'd them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning each in remembrance of himſelf, and particularly that they ſhould eat, and drink them with that deſign. Which they of all Men, ought not to refuſe, who are taught by the <hi>Canon</hi> of the Maſs to look upon the words, <hi>Hoc eſt enim corpus meum,</hi> and, <hi>Hic eſt enim calix ſanguinis mei</hi> (for ſo the <hi>Roman</hi> Miſſal expreſſeth them) as a Reaſon of what is before enjoin'd, and particularly of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:56517:183"/>eating, and drinking the things given to them. For if thoſe very words referr'd to what was before enjoyn'd, and particularly to their eating, and drinking the things given to them; The words, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> ought in reaſon to referr to the ſame eating, and drinking, and no otherwiſe to the Body, and Blood of Chriſt, than as that was an inducement to them to do what they did in remembrance of Him, and of his Death. But let us ſuppoſe however, becauſe ſome of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion will have it ſo, that the words, <hi>Do this,</hi> &amp;c. referr to the <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Chriſt, and that it muſt therefore be ſomewhat about thoſe, that this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Chriſt muſt be thought to enjoin. Yet how doth it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, which is the only thing, that can advantage them, that we are to underſtand thereby, <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> or <hi>make an Offering</hi> of them? For though I grant that if the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> be conſidered with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Chriſt's Body, and Blood, it muſt have another ſenſe, than we are wont to put upon it; Yet why ſhould it not ſignifie <hi>make,</hi> as well as <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> eſpecially when that ſenſe is both the moſt natural, and the moſt obvious one? For ſo it will yet more agree with the opinion theſe Men have of their converting the Bread, and Wine of the Sacrament into the Body, and Blood of Chriſt, and accordingly producing that Body, and Blood out of them. And indeed as one would think that they, who give the Prieſt the priviledge of making his God, ſhould be willing to underſtand the words in that ſenſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, ſetting thoſe aſide, there is nothing elſe from whence that Power can be colourably deduc'd; So one would think too, that they ſhould ſecure to themſelves that Power, before they pretend to offer him, as without which there can be no place for it. But let that Notion alſo, how natural ſoever even in their own opinion, be laid aſide with the reſt, if it be only to make way for that other of <hi>ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,</hi> or <hi>offering;</hi> Yet how will it appear that this latter one ought to have place here, or if it hath, that it denotes ſuch a ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, or offering, as they advance? For though the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, agreeably to the notion of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">

Though if that alſo ſhould be allow'd, which yet there is not the leaſt neceſſity of doing, yet will not the words, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

So little is there in the words themſelves, how favourably ſoever conſider'd, to oblige us to underſtand them of ſuch an Offering, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> advanceth. And we ſhall find them to ſignifie as little, though we take in the ſenſe of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church upon them, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable ſoever the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> affirms it to be unto its own:
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:56517:183"/>Becauſe though the Antients did all agree upon a Sacrifice, and, which is more, look'd upon thoſe words as either directly, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly obliging to the offering of it, yet (as hath been elſewhere<note n="(k)" place="margin">Part 2.</note> ſhewn) they advanc'd other kind of Sacrifices, than what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> now doth, and conſequently cannot be ſuppos'd to give any countenance to <hi>it.</hi> And I ſhall only add, that though <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi>

                     <p>The principal Argument of the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Fathers being thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd, and the Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſs</hi> ſo far forth depriv'd of its ſupport; We ſhall the leſs need to concern our ſelves about thoſe, which are of an inferiour rank, and in truth rather Aſſiſtants to the former Argument, than any proper proofs of the Sacrifice it ſelf. For what boots it to alledge that our Saviour's Prieſthood, like that of <hi>Melchizedek,</hi> being not to be extinguiſhed by death, we are in reaſon to preſume, that upon his departure hence, he appointed his Apoſtles, and their Succeſſors, to offer up continually that Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which <hi>Melchizedek</hi> firſt, and after him, our Saviour offer'd. For beſide that there is no appearance of <hi>Melchizedek</hi>'s offering up Bread and Wine, and we therefore not to argue from the Bread, and Wine, which he <hi>brought forth,</hi> that our <hi>Melchizedek</hi> was either to offer, or appoint any ſuch Sacrifice; Our <hi>Melchizedek</hi> was to <hi>abide for ever,</hi> as well as his <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> yea, he was to abide <hi>in his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> for ever, as well as in his <hi>Perſon.</hi> Witneſs not only the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt's</hi> affirming, that he was to be <hi>a Prieſt for ever,</hi> but St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s affirming alſo, that<note n="(m)" place="margin">Heb. 7.23, 24.</note> whereas the <hi>Aaronical</hi> Prieſts were of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to paſs over their Prieſthood from one to another, becauſe <hi>no one of them could continue by reaſon of Death,</hi> our <hi>Melchizedekian</hi> Prieſt, becauſe he was to abide for ever, was inveſted with an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Prieſthood,</hi> and ſuch as ſhould not <hi>paſs away from</hi> him. For what was this, but to ſay, that he ſhould keep his Prieſthood in his own Perſon, and ſhould not therefore either need, or be in a capacity to appoint other Prieſts in his room, or furniſh them with any Sacrifice to employ them?</p>
                     <p>There is as little force, if it be duly conſidered, in what the ſame <hi>Fathers</hi> alledge from the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi>
                        <note n="(n)" place="margin">Mal. 1.11.</note>, where it is ſaid, that <hi>from the riſing up of the Sun, unto the going down of the ſame, God's Name ſhould be great among the Gentiles, and that in every place Incenſe ſhould be offered unto his Name, and a pure Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> For though it be true, that the Antients appli'd this Text
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:56517:184"/>to the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, and thought that to be the <hi>pure Offering,</hi> which was to be offer'd up unto God; Yet as they, who did ſo, appli'd it rather to the <hi>Sign,</hi> than to the thing <hi>ſignifi'd</hi> (for ſo <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Origen</hi> apparently do) but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever repreſented it as an Euchariſtical, or Commemorative Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not as an Expiatory one; So they, who follow the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients too nearly, will find themſelves oblig'd by the preſent words to offer up <hi>Incenſe</hi> unto God, as well as that <hi>Oblation,</hi> whereof they ſpeak. For by the ſame reaſon that a ſtrict, and proper, and material <hi>Oblation</hi> is to be underſtood, by the ſame reaſon a true, and proper <hi>Incenſe</hi> is to be underſtood alſo, becauſe equally foretold by the Prophet, and coupled with the other. It is enough to ſalve the Prophecy, that God ſhould have his publick Worſhip among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and a Service as notorious, and more acceptable than the <hi>Jews</hi> Incenſe, and Oblations were. And he, that makes the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy to import any thing more, may as well argue from it the continuance of the <hi>Jewiſh Service</hi> among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> becauſe, if we take the Prophecy in the Letter, it cannot be thought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note any thing elſe, than the offering of the ſame <hi>Incenſe,</hi> and <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi> that the then <hi>Jews</hi> did, though more free from impurity than theirs. If the Prophecy had a more particular relation to the Euchariſt, as it ſhould ſeem by the Comments of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents that it had, I ſhould think it was rather becauſe it was an eminent part of the Chriſtian Service, and becauſe of thoſe Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Thankſgivings, which attended it, than for any formal Oblation of the Signs of it, or of that Body, and Blood of Chriſt, which it was ſignified by them. Which <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> (though elſewhere<note n="(o)" place="margin">Dial. cum Tryph. p. <hi>260.</hi>
                        </note> ſeeming to referr it to the very Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Bread, and the Cup of the Euchariſt) gives no ſmall countenance to, when in anſwer to <hi>Trypho</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi>

For if <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> thought, as he profeſſeth to do, that Prayers, and Thankſgivings were the only perfect, and acceptable Sacrifices, and that they too were the only things, which the Chriſtians had received to do, or offer in the Euchariſt it ſelf; Then did not the preſent Prophecy, either in his, or other Chriſtians opinion, referr more particularly to the Euchariſt upon the account of any proper Oblation of the Sign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> therefore, not daring to truſt too much to this Prophecy of <hi>Malachi,</hi> goes on to ſuggeſt, that the Sacrifice, which it advanceth, <hi>is not obſcurely intimated</hi> by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> where he
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:56517:184"/>tells his <hi>Corinthians</hi>
                        <note n="(q)" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.21.</note>, that they, who are polluted by parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the table of Devils, cannot be partakers of the Table of the Lord, underſtanding in both places by the word <hi>Table,</hi> an <hi>Altar;</hi> And conſequently (becauſe every Altar muſt have its <hi>Victime</hi>) that the Table, of which the Chriſtians partook, had its <hi>Victime</hi> alſo, even that <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Chriſt, which they profeſſed to partake of, and which he himſelf had before affirm'd the <hi>Bread,</hi> and <hi>Cup</hi> of the Euchariſt to be the <hi>Communion</hi> of. It is very well ſaid by the Council, that the Sacrifice, whereof it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats, is <hi>intimated</hi> by thoſe words of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> For, to be ſure, they are no plain, and expreſs declarations of it. But that it is <hi>not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely</hi> intimated by thoſe words of his, is a thing which we can by no means grant, becauſe we cannot grant that, which is the foundation of their Argument, even that St. <hi>Paul</hi> by <hi>Table,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood an <hi>Altar.</hi> For beſide that it is not eaſie to be thought, that even the Heathen Deities did ſo far forget the place they had uſurp'd, as to admit their Worſhippers to their own <hi>proper</hi> Tables (for ſo I take the <hi>Altars</hi> of thoſe Deities to have been) but only to have allow'd of their receiving by the hands of their Prieſts ſome Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from their Altars, and eating of them at Tables purpoſely prepared for them; It is manifeſt by the deſcription, which <hi>Virgil</hi>
                        <note n="(r)" place="margin">Aeneid. li. <hi>8.</hi> v. <hi>103, &amp;c.</hi> &amp; v. <hi>172</hi>—</note> gives us of this Affair, where he intreats of the Sacrifice of <hi>Hercules,</hi> that though the <hi>Gentiles</hi> partook of thoſe Meats, which were offer'd to their Idols, and might ſo far forth alſo be ſaid to partake with their Altars, and them, yet they did not eat of them at the Altars of their Idols, but on Tables prepared for them, for that purpoſe. Which ſuppos'd, neither St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Table of Devils,</hi> nor his <hi>Table of the Lord,</hi> will be found to be <hi>Altars,</hi> and no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therefore to be made from thence, that that Table of the Lord, imports the offering up of that Lord upon it, or that we are under any Obligation to make ſuch an Offering of him. The utmoſt, that can with reaſon be inferr'd from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s arguing from the <hi>one</hi> to the <hi>other Table,</hi> is, that as both of them preſuppoſe a Victime, or Sacrifice, ſo they in like manner ſuppoſe our Victime, or Sacrifice to be exhibited on that Table, which we Chriſtians are to partake of. Which though it may be no proof of the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of Chriſt's Body, and Blood upon it, yet may ſeem to be ſome proof of the Preſence of that very Body, and Blood upon it, which Chriſt ſometime offer'd upon the Altar of the Croſs. But as whoſoever ſhall conſider, that it was only a <hi>part</hi> of the Victime, that was brought from the Idols Altar to the Table of his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers, will find himſelf obliged to confeſs, either that there is no exact ſimilitude between the <hi>Devils</hi> Tables, and <hi>ours,</hi> or that we, no more than the Heathen, can expect the whole of our Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctime upon them, which is expreſly contrary to the Doctrine of the <hi>Romaniſts;</hi> So ſuppoſing the ſimilitude between them not to be exact (as no ſimilitude, they ſay, runs upon all four) there may be place for partaking of our Victime by means of that Bread, and Wine, which is prepared for us, as well as for the Heathens par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of their Victimes by means of thoſe parts thereof, that were ſet before them: Becauſe how far ſoever that Bread, and Wine may be <hi>in themſelves</hi> from being parts of our Victime, or Sacrifice,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:56517:185"/>or poſſeſſing us of the Benefits thereof; Yet they may, <hi>by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God,</hi> become a means of exhibiting that Victime, or Sacrifice to our Souls, and poſſeſſing us of the happy Fruits of it.</p>
                     <p>I know not whether I ought to take notice of what is added in the cloſe, That this is that Oblation, which is figur'd by the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Oblations of former days, as well thoſe which prevail'd in the time of <hi>Nature's</hi> Law, as thoſe which were in uſe under that of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Becauſe it doth not appear to me (which is the proof the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> gives of it) that it contains in it all thoſe good things, that are ſignified by the other, as the conſummation, and perfection of them. For neither (for ought that doth appear from the <hi>Roman Miſſal</hi>) doth it any way contain in it an Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the unconverted World; Neither doth it contain in it what it doth, as the conſummation, and perfection of thoſe Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, or Oblations, which were made in antient times: This (as I ſhall by and by ſhew) being the Priviledge of that Sacrifice, which our Saviour made of himſelf upon the Altar of the Croſs, and no other way belonging to the Euchariſt, than as a means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God to convey to us the Benefits of the other.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Now to make it appear to the World, that we are no more without Arguments againſt this pretended Sacrifice, than we are unprovided of Anſwers to what the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> alledge in its behalf, I will make it my Buſineſs to ſhew,

                     <p>That this Sacrifice, as explain'd by thoſe that advance it, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with it ſelf, will need no other proof, than that <hi>unbloody Immolation,</hi> or Offering, which is attributed to it. For how is that an Immolation, or Offering (underſtanding it as they do of a propitiatory Sacrifice) which is without any ſhedding of Blood, when both the Old, and the New Teſtament aſſure us, that it was the <hi>Blood,</hi> which <hi>was to make the Atomement,</hi> and that <hi>without ſhedding of Blood there is no Remiſſion?</hi> For what is this, but to ſay that it is a Sacrifice, and no Sacrifice, that it is a truly propitiatory Sacrifice for the quick, and dead, and yet hath nothing of that, which is to make a Propitiation for them? It is true indeed that an <hi>unbloody Immolation,</hi> or Offering, is an Expreſſion that may paſs well enough, where it is attributed to that, which is rather the Commemoration of a Sacrifice, than any true, and proper one. But to attribute ſuch an Immolation, or Offering to a Sacrifice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo call'd, is to deny it to be what we affirm it, and indeed rather a piece of nonſenſe, than any legitimate Predication, or ſo much as a witty one.</p>
                     <pb n="281" facs="tcp:56517:185"/>
                     <p>But beſide that this Sacrifice, as explain'd by the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves, is inconſiſtent with it ſelf, and as ſuch therefore might be reaſonably rejected; We ſhall find it to be as inconſiſtent with the preſent ſtate of our Lord, and Saviour, and indeed directly contrary to it. For if there be any kind of <hi>Propriety</hi> in the Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that is offer'd to it, it muſt betoken ſome kind of violence to be offer'd to that Body, which is the ſubject of it, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of a glorious Body, make it an inglorious one. Which they of all Men ought not to refuſe, who do ſometime tell us of the <hi>bleeding of the Hoſt,</hi> and ſo turn this <hi>unbloody</hi> Immolation into a <hi>bloody</hi> one. Neither will it avail to ſay, as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> doth, and their <hi>Authors</hi> commonly gloſs this Immolation, That this Body of Chriſt is offer'd <hi>under the Species of Bread, and Wine,</hi> and again <hi>under the viſible Signs.</hi> For whether under the Species, or no, yet ſtill according to them Chriſt is truly immolated; Neither is there any more difference between the Immolations, than there would have been between the murdering of an Infant cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over with Meal, as the <hi>Heathen</hi> in <hi>Minutius Felix</hi> chargeth the Primitive Chriſtians to have done, and the murdering of one under no ſuch diſguiſe. For as the Murder is the ſame in both, ſo the Immolation muſt be ſo too, and thoſe Species can no more priviledge our Saviour's Body from violence, than the Meal, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with an Infant is covered, can hinder the violence that is offer'd to it, to be really a Murder, or thoſe, that offer it, from being really guilty of one.</p>
                     <p>But that, which is moſt to be conſider'd in this Affair, and is in truth the greateſt prejudice againſt this pretended Sacrifice, is, that it is extreamly derogatory to the dignity of that Sacrifice, which Chriſt made of himſelf upon the Altar of the Croſs. For whereas it is the peculiar Priviledge of this Sacrifice to be ſo perfect, as not to need to be repeated, whilſt thoſe of the <hi>Levitical Law</hi> daily were (For <hi>every Prieſt,</hi> ſaith the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
                        <note n="(s)" place="margin">Heb. 10.11, &amp;c.</note> 
                        <hi>ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth daily miniſtring, and offering oftentimes the ſame Sacrifices, which can never take away Sins. But this Man, after he had offer'd one Sacrifice for Sin, for ever ſat down on the right hand of God, From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footſtool</hi>) The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Maſs doth at the beſt pretend to repeat that Sacrifice, and, though in another way, to offer it up again, yea, makes our Saviour himſelf to do it by the Miniſtry of his Prieſts. Whereas, again, it is the Priviledge of that Sacrifice, which our Saviour made of himſelf upon the Croſs, to procure <hi>eternal Redemption</hi> for us<note n="(t)" place="margin">Heb. 9.12.</note>, and ſuch a Redemption too<note n="(u)" place="margin">Heb. 9.15.</note>, as ſhould draw after it the receit of <hi>an eternal Inheritance,</hi> in the mean time <hi>ſo perfecting for ever them, that are ſanctified</hi>
                        <note n="(w)" place="margin">Heb. 10.14.</note>, <hi>that they ſhould not only not need any more offering for Sin, but have boldneſs by the Blood</hi> of it <hi>to enter into the Holieſt;</hi> The ſacrifice of the Maſs, by pretending to be a truly propitiatory one, makes the <hi>redemption</hi> of that form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Sacrifice to be <hi>imperfect,</hi> as without which there could have been no need of a farther propitiatory one, and much leſs of the frequent offering of it. Neither will it ſuffice to argue, as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſeems to do, that that cannot be thought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from Chriſt's Sacrifice upon the Croſs, which is taught by
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:56517:186"/>themſelves to be a <hi>Means, whereby the fruits of the other are moſt plentifully convey'd.</hi> For either it is ſuch a Means, as doth alſo propitiate God, and then it will however derogate from the Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, and Redemption of the other, or it is not ſuch a Means, and then it is not a Propitiatory Sacrifice at all. If there be any thing to hinder this pretended Sacrifice from entrenching upon that of the Croſs, it muſt be by attributing to it another, and a lower ſort of Propitiation, than they think to be due unto the other. But as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſeems ſo far from allowing that, that it profeſſeth to believe that God is ſo far appeas'd with the Oblation of this Sacrifice, as to grant Repentance and Pardon of Sin upon it, and (as one would think too by the Reaſon annexed) with little difference from what is granted upon the Sacrifice of Chriſt upon the Croſs (For <hi>it is,</hi> ſaith that Council, <hi>one, and the ſame Hoſt that is offer'd, it is one, and the ſame Perſon, that now offers it by the miniſtry of his Prieſts, who then offer'd up himſelf upon the Croſs, only after a different manner of offering</hi>) ſo the great Truſt their People are prompted to repoſe on this Oblation, even when they do not communicate at it, as that too upon the account of its being offer'd up for all the Faithful, and for thoſe in particular, that are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd by name in it, gives cauſe enough to believe, that they think not much otherwiſe of it, than they do of that Oblation, which Chriſt made of himſelf upon the Croſs, if yet, becauſe of the more particular application of it to themſelves, they do not entertain a higher opinion of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The <hi>manner</hi> of the Adminiſtration of this Sacrament being thus accounted for, and conſideration therein had of what is moſt in controverſie in it; It remains that I enquire, <hi>To whom</hi> it ought to be adminiſtred. Which in the general are ſuch, as have given up their Names to Chriſt, for ſo our Saviour firſt adminiſtred it, and no doubt therefore intended that it ſhould afterwards be: More particularly thoſe of them, who are qualified by their Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Life, to partake worthily of it, to do what they do in remembrance of Chriſt, and to the comfort and benefit of their own Souls, the ſalvation whereof was thereby intended. Which both general, and particular Qualifications, <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> ſeems not obſcurely to inſinuate<note n="(x)" place="margin">Apol. <hi>2.</hi> pag. <hi>97.</hi>
                        </note>, when immediately after the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he gives us of the Adminiſtration of this Sacrament in his time, he tells us, that the <hi>Euchariſtical Food thereof was lawful for none to partake of, but him that believ'd thoſe things to be true, that were taught by them, who was moreover waſh'd in that Laver, which was appointed for remiſſion of Sins, and liv'd alſo as Chriſt deliver'd to us.</hi> If there be any conſiderable difficulty in this Affair, it is about the Adminiſtration of this Sacrament to Infants, and which as ſome Ages of the Church ſeem to believe to have been neceſſary, ſo one<note n="(y)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Jer. Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi>'s Worthy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>ſect.</hi> 2.</note> among our ſelves hath taken upon him to defend, as to the <hi>lawfulneſs thereof.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As touching the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of its Adminiſtration to Infants, little needs to be ſaid, becauſe it is manifeſtly built upon a Text, which conſidered without prejudice, cannot tend in the leaſt to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of it. That, I mean, where it is ſaid, that, <hi>unleſs we eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, we can have no
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:56517:186"/>Life in us.</hi> For it appearing from the Text it ſelf, and from what I have elſewhere<note n="(z)" place="margin">Part 7.</note> ſaid upon it, that this Paſſage relates not to a <hi>Sacramental</hi> Manducation, but rather to a <hi>Spiritual</hi> one, the Communion of Infants is ſo far from being eſtabliſhed by it, that the Communion even of elder Perſons cannot be concluded from it.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe the Queſtion is not ſo much at preſent concerning the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of adminiſtring this Sacrament to Infants, as concerning the <hi>lawfulneſs</hi> thereof; And becauſe he, who profeſſeth to deny the one, hath taken upon him to defend the other, and the Practice of ſeveral of the Antients in it; I think it not amiſs to make that alſo the ſubject of my Diſcourſe, and both ſhew why I look upon it as a thing no way lawful, and examine the Arguments, that are brought in the behalf of it.</p>
                     <p>That, which makes me look upon it as no way lawful to adminiſter this Sacrament to Infants, is their being not in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to anſwer what is requir'd on the part of Communicants, whether before, or in the receiving of it. For neither can they, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> requires, <hi>examine themſelves</hi> before they addreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to this Sacrament, neither can they (which is more mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, and requir'd by Chriſt himſelf) do what they do in it <hi>in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance</hi> of Chriſt, and of his Death. By which means as they muſt be look'd upon as no way qualified for it, ſo, as ſuch, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore excluded from the participation of it by him, who was the Inſtituter thereof. Neither will it avail to ſay, as the forequoted Author objects, that the former of theſe Precepts concerns thoſe only, that need an examination, and have an ability for it, and conſequently cannot concern Infants, in whom no ſuch need, or ability is. For as I willingly grant, that that Precept doth not concern Infants, ſo I think therfore that they have as little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment in that Sacrament, to which ſuch an Examination is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requir'd: He, who cannot do that, which is prerequir'd to the receiving of any Sacrament, being to be look'd upon as one, for whom that Sacrament was never intended, and conſequently as one, who ought not to be admitted to it. Otherwiſe we muſt ſuppoſe Chriſt to have intended his Sacraments for thoſe, who are not in a condition to perform ſuch things, as are prerequir'd by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the partaking of it. I am yet leſs concern'd at what the ſame Author ſeems to anſwer to what our Saviour enjoins concerning the <hi>doing</hi> what we do in this Sacrament <hi>in remembrance</hi> of him, and of his Death. For as all the Anſwer he makes to it is, that one may <hi>ſhew</hi> forth Chriſt's Death, by the very Act of Communicating, and conſequently that Infants, becauſe capable of that Act, may ſhew forth Chriſt's Death alſo; So that Anſwer is defective in this, that it ſuppoſeth the ſhewing forth of Chriſt's Death to others to be all, that our Saviour requir'd by doing what we do in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him. The contrary whereof is evident, becauſe he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Communicant but juſt before to take what is given him as his <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> and his Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> adjudge ſome Communicants to condemnation for <hi>not diſcerning</hi> in themſelves the Lord's Body. Both which Paſſages ſuppoſe that the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant ought to reflect in his own Mind upon the Death of our
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:56517:187"/>Lord, and Saviour, as well as ſhew it forth to other Men. If therefore the Communion of Infants receive any relief, it muſt be from thoſe Arguments, that are alledg'd in its behalf, and which accordingly I come now to conſider.</p>
                     <p>And firſt it is alledg'd that <hi>the Sacraments of the Goſpel are the great Chanels of the Grace of God;</hi> Which is willingly granted, if it be underſtood as to thoſe Perſons, for whom they were intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But whether this in particular, was intended for Infants, is a thing which, for the Reaſons before mentioned, may very well be made a Queſtion, but ought however to be otherwiſe made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. Which it will hardly be by alledging, as it is in the ſecond place, that that <hi>Grace doth always deſcend upon them, that do not hinder it:</hi> Becauſe if God require ſome poſitive qualifications in him, that receives the Sacrament, the not putting a bar to the Grace of it will not ſuffice the Party for the receiving of it. There was therefore but need of adding thirdly, that <hi>to Baptiſm there are many acts of prediſpoſition requir'd, as well as to the Communion, and yet the Church, who very well underſtands the obligation of thoſe Precepts, ſuppoſeth no Children to be obliged to thoſe prediſpoſitions to either, but fits every Commandment to a capable ſubject.</hi> The meaning of which Argument, ſetting aſide what is there ſaid of the Church, is, that if the want of ſuch Diſpoſitions, as are prerequir'd to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, do not hinder Infants from being admitted to it, neither ought the want of the like prediſpoſitions to the Communion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar them of that, or hinder us from believing that our Saviour did intend it for them. And I willingly grant there would be the ſame reaſon for both, if there were the like preſumption of God's diſpenſing with his own Law in both, and admitting Infants, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding thoſe wants, to the participation of the Lord's Supper, as there is for his admiſſion of them to Baptiſm. Which that there is not, will appear as from the Arguments I have elſewhere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd for the Baptizing of them, ſo from the neceſſity there is of the one, above what there can be of the other. For whereas there is a neceſſity of Baptiſm to bring Infants out of their natural eſtate, and give them a title to his Kingdom. (For <hi>except a Man be born again, ſaith our</hi> Saviour<note n="(a)" place="margin">Joh. 3.5.</note>, <hi>of Water, and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven</hi>) There cannot be the like neceſſity of their receiving the Lord's Supper, becauſe before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from that their natural eſtate, and entitled to his heavenly Kingdom. Whereas again the Grace of Baptiſm, ordinarily ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is abſolutely neceſſary, ſo that no one can without that be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd to be in a ſalvable eſtate; The Lord's Supper may ſeem to be only conditionally ſo, and on ſuppoſition<note n="(b)" place="margin">See Part 1.</note> of our falling into new Errors, and ſo needing a new Remedy againſt them, and a new aſſurance againſt the guilt of them. Which new Errors falling not upon an Infant eſtate, neither can there be any ſuch need of that either Remedy or Aſſurance, and therefore neither of that ſecond Sacrament, which was intended to convey them. Though therefore God ſhould admit Infants to Baptiſm without the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious diſpoſitions of it, becauſe of the neceſſity of that Sacrament; Yet there is not the like Reaſon to preſume, becauſe there is no ſuch neceſſity of the Sacrament it ſelf, of his ſo admitting them to
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:56517:187"/>the Lord's Supper, and therefore neither for arguing from the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Baptiſm to Infants, that we may as well adminiſter to them the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper alſo. It is alledged, fourthly, That whereas <hi>in a Sacrament there is ſomething done on God's part, and ſomething on ours, what belongeth to us obligeth us then, when we can hear, and underſtand, but not before; but what is on God's part, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready to them that can receive it.</hi> Which Allegation is indeed true, but no way pertinent to the matter in hand, unleſs it could be prov'd, which hath not as yet been, that this Sacrament belongs to Infants, either as to its Obligations, or Graces. It is alledged, fifthly, and with as little pertinency, That <hi>though Infants cannot come alone to Chriſt, yet the Church their Mother can bring them in her Arms.</hi> For though the Church can bring them in her Arms, yet ſhe will bring them with little effect, if ſhe bring them to other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, than Chriſt hath appointed for them. It is alledged, ſixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That <hi>they, who are capable of the Grace of a Sacrament, may alſo receive the Sign, and therefore the ſame Grace being convey'd to them in one Sacrament, may alſo be imparted to them in the other.</hi> But as I do not ſee how Infants are capable of the Grace of the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, becauſe intended to ſupply thoſe defects, which the neglect of the former hath occaſioned; So I ſee as little what need, or expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there is of their receiving that Grace by a ſecond Sacrament, which hath been already imparted to them by a former. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, ſeventhly, That <hi>as Infants can be born again without their own conſent, ſo they may be fed by the hands of others, and what begins without their own actual choice, may be renewed without their own actual deſire.</hi> Both parts of which Allegation ſuppoſe that Infants ſtand in need of Spiritual Supplies, which I for my part, ſee no neceſſity to grant, nor indeed any reaſon to believe: Becauſe till they come to years, they are out of the reach of thoſe temptations, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion our ſpiritual decays. It is alledged, eighthly, That <hi>if upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of figurative Speeches, Allegories, and Alluſions, and the Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of certain Diſpoſitions, the holy Communion be deny'd to Infants, there may be cauſe enough to fear that a gap may be opened upon equal pretence to deny them Baptiſm.</hi> The latter part of which Argument as I have already return'd a ſufficient Anſwer to, ſo I ſhall leave it to thoſe, who trade in figurative Speeches, and Allegories, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions to anſwer to the former. It is alledged, ninthly, which looks ſomewhat more like an Argument, than many of the former, <hi>That ſince the Jewiſh Infants being circumciſed, is uſed as an Argument, that they might be baptiz'd, their eating of the Paſchal Lamb may alſo be a competent Warrant to eat of that Sacrament, in which alſo, as in the other, the ſacrificed Lamb is repreſented as offer'd, and ſlain for them.</hi> But as the Parallel is not ſo clear in the Scripture between the Paſchal Lamb, and the Lord's Supper, as it is between Circumciſion, and Baptiſm, and we therefore not to argue with the ſame freedom from the Paſchal Lamb to the Lord's Supper, as we do from Circumciſion to Baptiſm; So it is much farther from being clear, that the Jewiſh <hi>Infants</hi> partook of the Paſchal Lamb, which is that, upon which the preſent Argument proceeds. For all that is ſaid in the Book of <hi>Exodus,</hi> is, that it was to be eaten by the Houſhold<note n="(c)" place="margin">Exo. 12.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

At, or after which time they might be in a capacity to enquire into the meaning of their Paſchal Service, and receive a due information concerning it. Which, inſtead of juſtifying the communicating of Infants, will rather overthrow it, and perſwade the deferring of it, till they be of underſtanding to conſider the nature of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and prepare themſelves in ſome meaſure for the receiving of it. One only Argument remains for the adminiſtring of this Sacrament to Infants, even the <hi>long,</hi> and <hi>general practice</hi> of the <hi>Antient</hi> Church in this particular, and the like general practice at this day of the <hi>Greeks, Aethiopians, Bohemians,</hi> and <hi>Moravians.</hi> All which to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn of Errour may ſeem a little hard, as we muſt do, unleſs we will at leaſt allow of the lawfulneſs of the Practice, whatſoever we do of the neceſſity thereof. But as I muſt needs ſay, that I do not ſee, how we can acquit them for Errour, conſidering what hath been before ſaid againſt the Communion of Infants; So I a little wonder how he ſhould ſtick at the condemnation of the thing it ſelf, who ſo freely acknowledg'd the Practice to be built upon a Text, which he himſelf confeſſeth to have been miſtaken by them. The utmoſt, in my opinion, that is to be ſaid in behalf of the Antients, and accordingly of thoſe Churches, which derive their Practice from them, is, that the Communicating of Infants was an Errour of their charity toward them, and whom whilſt they were willing to deliver from that Original Corruption, wherein they were born, and bring them to Chriſt's Kingdom, and Happineſs, they did not only conferr upon them the Sacrament of Baptiſm, which they had learn'd from the words of our Saviour<note n="(f)" place="margin">Mark 10.13.</note>, the Doctrine of St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <note n="(g)" place="margin">1 Cor. 7.14.</note>, and the Circumciſion of the Jewiſh Infants to be but proper for them, but miſtaking what our Saviour ſpake in St. <hi>John</hi> concerning the neceſſity of eating his Fleſh, and drinking his Blood, for the neceſſity of a Sacramental Manducation, gave them this Sacrament alſo, ſo the better to ſecure them of eternal Life, and Heaven.

In like manner, though Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> to ſhew the fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> in affirming that little Children could have eternal Life without Baptiſm, make uſe of theſe very words to prove it, <hi>For unleſs they ſhall eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, they ſhall have no Life in them;</hi> Yet whoſoever ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what he ſaith, as it is worded by himſelf, will find that he did not at all intend their receiving the Fleſh, and Blood of Chriſt in the Sacrament of Baptiſm, but in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, and that he eſteem'd that Sacrament to be as neceſſary as the former, and intended to prove the neceſſity of Baptiſm by the neceſſity of that Sacrament, which was to follow it. For thus he in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Milevitan</hi> Council. <hi>Now that, which your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood affirms them to preach, that little Children may have their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of eternal Life</hi> even <hi>without the Grace of Baptiſm, is extreamly fooliſh. For unleſs they ſhall eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, they ſhall not have Life in them.</hi> For what was this but to ſay, that they ſhould be ſo far from having eternal Life without the Grace of Baptiſm, that they could not, by the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel, attain that Life without the Grace of the Euchariſt alſo?

                        <p>The <hi>receit</hi> of this Sacrament ſuppos'd by the preſent Queſtion, and that therefore firſt eſtabliſhed againſt the Doctrine of thoſe, who make the ſuppoſed <hi>Sacrifice</hi> thereof to be of uſe to them, who partake not Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally of it. Enquiry next made, How we ought to prepare our ſelves for it, how to demean our ſelves at the celebration of it, and in what Poſture to receive it. The preparation taken notice of by our <hi>Catechiſm</hi> the Examination of our ſelves, whether we truly repent us of our ſins, ſtedfaſtly purpoſing to lead a new Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the both neceſſity, and means of that Examination accordingly declar'd. The examination of our Repentance more particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon, and that ſhewn to be moſt advantageouſly made by enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how we have gain'd upon thoſe ſins, which we profeſs to repent of, and particularly upon our moſt prevailing ones, which how they are to be diſcover'd, is therefore enquir'd into, and the marks, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are to be known, aſſigned, and explain'd. A tranſition from thence to the examination of the ſtedfaſtneſs of our Purpoſes to lead a new Life, of our Faith in God through Chriſt, our remembrance of his Death, and Charity; Where the neceſſity of that Examination is evinced, and the means whereby we may come to know whether we have thoſe Qualifications in us, diſcover'd, and declar'd. How we ought to demean our ſelves at the celebration of this Sacrament in the next place enquir'd into, and that ſhewn to be by intending that Service, wherewith it is celebrated, and ſuiting our Affections to the ſeveral parts of it. The whole concluded with enquiring, in what poſture of Body this Sacrament ought to be receiv'd; Where is ſhewn, firſt, that the Antients, ſo far as we can judge by their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, receiv'd in a poſture of Adoration, and particularly, in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of ſtanding; Secondly, that ſeveral of the Reformed Churches receive in that, or the like poſture, and that thoſe, that do not, do not condemn thoſe that do; Thirdly, that there is nothing in the Example of Chriſt, and his Diſciples at the firſt Celebration of this Supper, to oblige us to receive it <hi>ſitting,</hi> nor yet in what is alledg'd from the ſuitableneſs of that Poſture to a Feaſt, and conſequently to the preſent one: This, as it is a Feaſt of a different nature from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

                     <p>That the Faithful are under an obligation of receiving this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as of aſſiſting at the celebration of it, is ſo evident from the words of the Inſtitution, that I know not how our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour could have more expreſly enjoin'd it. For, <hi>Take, Eat,</hi> ſaith he, concerning the <hi>Bread</hi> of it; And, <hi>Drink ye all of it,</hi> ſaith the ſame Jeſus concerning the <hi>Cup:</hi> With this farther Reaſon, as we learn from the <hi>Hoc eſt enim corpus meum,</hi> and, <hi>Hic eſt enim calix ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinis mei</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> Miſſal, becauſe the one is his <hi>Body,</hi> and the other as certainly the <hi>Cup of his Blood,</hi> as that <hi>Miſſal</hi> expreſſeth it. So that if a Command, with ſo ſubſtantial a Reaſon annex'd, may be concluded to be obligatory, the receit of this Sacrament is; And we can no more be freed from doing it, than we can be freed from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:56517:190"/>that it is Chriſt's Body, and Blood, that is tender'd to us, or, believing it, than we may reject ſo ſignal a Bleſſing as that is, which was either <hi>broken,</hi> or <hi>ſhed</hi> for our Redemption. For what is this, but (as the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſpeaks<note n="(c)" place="margin">Heb. 10.28, 29.</note>) to deſpiſe not <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, but one, <hi>the tranſgreſſion whereof is worthy of a ſorer puniſhment,</hi> yea, <hi>to tread under foot the Son of God, and count the Blood of the Covenant, wherewith we are ſanctified, an unholy thing,</hi> and as ſuch contemptuouſly to reject it? Neither will it avail to ſay, as poſſibly it may be, that they cannot be look'd upon as deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of Chriſt's <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> who do, even when they avoid the partaking thereof, humbly, and devoutly adore them. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be ſaid of that adoration of Chriſt's Body, and Blood; To adore them, is not to eat, or drink of the Symbols of them, and that Law therefore, that enjoins both the one, and the other, as much deſpis'd, as if they ador'd them a thouſand times, and, together therewith, that Body, and Blood, which it ſo graciouſly enjoins us to partake of. Agreeable to this Command of our Saviour concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>eating,</hi> and <hi>drinking</hi> the Sacramental Elements, is his own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning to the mention of each of thoſe <hi>Acts</hi>

And to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s reckoning that <hi>eating,</hi> and <hi>drinking</hi> in the number of thoſe things, whereby we are to <hi>ſhew</hi>

                     <p>A Man would think that theſe Arguments were of ſufficient force to ſhew our receit of the Sacramental Elements to be a thing ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily enjoin'd upon us, and without the doing whereof therefore we cannot expect to reap the benefit of them. But the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers tell us another ſtory, and as they have transform'd a Sacrament of Chriſt, into a Sacrifice of their own making, ſo they tell us that that Sacrifice, though the Prieſt alone partake Sacramentally of it, is common to thoſe that do not, Partly, <hi>becauſe the people communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ſpiritually in it</hi>
                        <note n="(i)" place="margin">Seſſ. <hi>22.</hi> cap. <hi>6.</hi>
                        </note>, and <hi>partly becauſe it is celebrated by the publick Miniſter of the Church, not only for himſelf, but for all the Faithful, that pertain to Chriſt's Body.</hi> It is very well, though I think not very agreeably to their own Principles, that they make the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monneſs of ſuch Maſſes, or Sacrifices, to conſiſt partly in the <hi>Peoples communicating ſpiritually in them;</hi> For ſo ſome kind of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting will appear to be neceſſary, whatever the Sacramental one is, which I do not ſee how the <hi>Dead</hi> are capable of. But certainly, <hi>Take, Eat,</hi> or (as the <hi>Roman Miſſal</hi> reads it) <hi>Take, and eat ye all of this,</hi> and, <hi>drink ye all of this,</hi> betoken a <hi>Sacramental</hi> eating, and drinking,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:56517:191" rendition="simple:additions"/>as well as a <hi>Spiritual</hi> one. Otherwiſe thoſe words will be ill em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd to prove that <hi>corporal</hi> manducation and drinking of Chriſt's Body, and Blood, which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> ſo ſtudiouſly advance. Now if Chriſt himſelf require a Sacramental communicating at the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Lord's Supper, or (as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> are pleas'd to phraſe it) at the celebration of the Maſs, I doubt a bare Spiritual communicating at it will hardly obtain the benefit thereof for thoſe, who do ſo communicate, when they may paſs to a Sacramental one. This I take to be a ſufficient Anſwer to what is alledged in the firſt place for thoſe Maſſes, at which the Prieſt only communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, being <hi>common</hi> to the People with him. And I think it will be as eaſie to anſwer to what is alledged for it in the ſecond place, from thoſe Maſſes <hi>being offer'd up by the publick Miniſter of the Church, not only for himſelf, but for all the Faithful, that pertain to the Body of Chriſt.</hi> For granting ſuch an Offering, as is pretended, yet can <hi>they</hi> not expect the benefit of it, who partake not of it as he enjoin'd, who was both the Inſtituter, and Exemplar of it; The Sacrifice of the Croſs of Chriſt being no farther available to any, than it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and applied, as he, who offer'd it up, appointed.</p>
                     <p>But to return to that, which is the proper ſubject of this Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, even to ſhew how this Sacrament ought to be received by us; Where again I will enquire,

                     <p n="1">1. It is the firſt of theſe, which our Catechiſm ſpeaks to, even how we ought to prepare our ſelves for it. Which it affirms to be by <hi>examining our ſelves, whether we repent us truly of our ſins, ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly purpoſing to lead a new Life, have a lively Faith in God's Mercy through Chriſt, with a thankful remembrance of his Death, and be in Charity with all Men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That we ought to examine our ſelves about the <hi>truth</hi> of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is manifeſt, on the one hand, from the neceſſity thereof toward the procuring of that Pardon, which this Sacrament is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to convey, and on the other from our aptneſs to be deceived in it. For, generally ſpeaking, every little ſorrow for ſin, though it be occaſion'd only by what we are likely to ſuffer by it, paſſeth with us for true Repentance; And provided we lament our ſins, upon what account ſoever it be, we think our ſelves truly penitent, and as ſuch therefore duly qualified for that, or any other religious perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. But as it appears from what I have elſewhere ſaid<note n="(k)" place="margin">Expl. of Bapt. Part 10.</note>, that the Repentance, which the Goſpel requires, is a <hi>repentance toward God,</hi> and a <hi>ſorrow according to God,</hi> and muſt therefore proceed from a due ſenſe of the affront we have offer'd, whether to his <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> or <hi>Kindneſs;</hi> So the beſt, and moſt certain way to know whether our Repentance be ſuch, is by the amendment it produceth in us, and particularly as to thoſe Errors, that prevail moſt in us, and which the Scripture entitles<note n="(l)" place="margin">1 Kings 8.38.</note> the <hi>plague of a man's own heart.</hi> For he, that finds himſelf to gain upon theſe, needs not ſuſpect the truth of his Repentance, becauſe nothing elſe, but a due ſorrow for Sin, can carry a Man to abandon that, to which the bent of his own nature doth forcibly encline him. Upon which account I ſhould
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:56517:191"/>adviſe that, inſtead of running over a long catalogue of ſins, which few Men have leiſure for, and doth however but divert them from the main, they would endeavour to find out their moſt prevailing ſins, and examine the truth of their Repentance by their conqueſt over them. In order whereunto, I ſhall lay down three <gap reason="foreign">

For as he is in reaſon to be look'd upon as our Lord, and Maſter, to whom we yield our ſelves Servants to obey, and we therefore may conclude that God is our Maſter, if we conform to his Precepts, but Sin, if we perform the Luſts thereof; So if we have different ſins, that that is our Chief, to whom we do moſt often pay obedience. And this <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, or <hi>mark</hi> I do the rather alledge, becauſe it is one of the moſt infallible, and one too of the moſt plain, and obvious.

Even as when any Water carries in it the taſte of Sulphur, or any ſuch mineral ſubſtance, we do not only conclude it to have paſs'd through a tainted Earth, but through ſuch particular Veins, where thoſe mineral ſubſtances abound, the ſcent, or taſte of which thoſe Waters do moſt partake of. Again, as the foremention'd <gap reason="foreign">

For though, as the Scripture ſpeaks<note n="(p)" place="margin">Prov. 20.5.</note>, <hi>the Heart of Man be a great depth;</hi> Though, as the ſame Scripture expreſſeth it<note n="(q)" place="margin">Jer. 17.9.</note>, <hi>it be deceitful above all things,</hi> as well as <hi>deſperately wicked,</hi> and conſequently the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings thereof not eaſie to be trac'd, even by the thoughts of that Heart it ſelf; Yet the actions of Men, by which we are before taught to judge, are apparent, and obvious, they are evident to our Senſe, as well as to our Underſtanding: And though we cannot otherwiſe ſo well tell what kind of Plague is within, yet ſurely we may tell in what kind of Spots, or Blotches it moſt breaks out, and what Parts, or Members it moſt ſeizeth on.</p>
                     <p>But as we may know our prevailing Sin, by our often commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it, more than of any other, ſo alſo by our great unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to hear of it, and our equal diſguſt of thoſe Diſcourſes that are made againſt it. For it is with every particular Soul, that is not devoid of all goodneſs, as the Scripture tells us, it was with <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>

<pb n="294" facs="tcp:56517:192"/>Preacher of Repentance, with a great deal of Complacency, when he toucheth upon ſome ſins, and thoſe too, which perhaps we our ſelves are not altogether guiltleſs of. But when the ſame perſon comes to touch upon others, when he comes to tell us of marrying our Brother <hi>Philip</hi>'s Wife, then our Hearts riſe both againſt the Preacher, and his Doctrine, and that <hi>Voice,</hi> which (as the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeaks<note n="(s)" place="margin">Ezek. 33.32.</note>) was before <hi>as a lovely Song of one, that hath a pleaſant Voice, and can play well upon an Inſtrument,</hi> doth now ſound as harſh as the croaking of a Raven, or the groans of one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting out of the World. Of which difference, as was before inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, what reaſon can be given, but that it is our beloved ſin, the dear Plague of our own Heart: And indeed, ſo far are we from brooking a Reproof from another, of the ſin we do moſt indulge, That we cannot ſo much as endure to hear of it from our ſelves, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune with our own Hearts about it. A Character, which I chooſe rather to inſiſt upon, as becauſe it is ſomewhat of kin to the former, ſo becauſe even they, who avoid communing with their own Hearts, cannot but obſerve, and take notice of it. For though a Man may avoid the conſidering what the plague of his own Heart is, yet he cannot but ſee what that ſin is, which he moſt flies the thought of, which is enough to ſhew him what the plague of his own Heart is. And it brings to my Mind the obſervation of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> touching the Effigies of <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius,</hi> not appearing in the Funeral of <hi>Junia.</hi> For as it is affirmed by him, that <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius</hi> ſhone ſo much the more, becauſe their Images were not ſeen at it; So our prevailing ſins cannot be made more conſpicuous, than they are by our ſtudious ſuppreſſing the thought of them: Inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as we would not do ſo, but that we ſhould thereby be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to give them a Bill of Divorce, which ſhews how nearly link'd we are to them in our Affections.</p>

                        </gap>, or <hi>mark,</hi> whereby to judge of our prevailing ſin, is our Conſtitution, Age, or courſe of Life; Thoſe ſins, which do moſt ſymbolize with theſe, being moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly our prevailing ones. For as it is eaſie to ſuppoſe, that the Devil will moſt aſſault us there, where he finds us moſt eaſie to be overcome; So alſo becauſe the buſineſs of Sin is to gratifie our Paſſions, and Inclinations, that the evil of our Hearts will moſtly run out that way, whereto thoſe unruly Guides lead us. Thus if Choler, and an angry Temper predominate in us, our reigning ſin is Malice, and Revenge; If a ſoft and effeminate one, Laſciviouſneſs, and Uncleanneſs, with all other the works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. If we are of a meek, and humble temper, our prevailing ſin is want of courage in executing the Commands of our Creator. If of a bold and confident one, Pride, and Haughtineſs, and the deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of all thoſe, that are below us. The ſame is to be ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the different <hi>Ages</hi> of Men, and particularly of Youth, and old Age. For, according to theſe, Mens prevailing ſins are many times diverſe, not only from other Mens, but from their own. For thus Youth is generally tainted with the ſins of Pleaſure and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and ſuch other ſins, as beſt ſuit with their green, and giddy thoughts; Whilſt the prevailing ſin of old Age, is an exceſs of love
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:56517:192"/>to the World, and taking more care for the ſhort remainder of their Life, than they did before for a much longer one. Laſtly (that I may ſpeak ſomewhat of that alſo, as being an excellent means to come to the knowledge of our prevailing ſin) if our courſe of Life lead us to converſe in Courts, our prevailing ſin is generally Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xury, and Vanity; If in a City, or other place of Trade, Deceit, and Covetouſneſs; If in a mean eſtate any where, repining, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring; If in a more honourable one, oppreſſing, or Lording it over other Men. By one, or other of theſe marks, a Man may come to know his prevailing Sin, and, knowing it, to know alſo the truth of his repentance for them, and others. For if he finds himſelf to get ground on ſuch ſins, he ſhall not need to doubt of the truth of his Repentance, becauſe there cannot be a better proof of that, than its leading Men to abandon their ſins, and particularly ſuch of them, as have the greateſt force with the committers of them, and are therefore the moſt difficult to be overcome.</p>
                     <p>And though it be true, that all Men neither have, nor can have that proof of their Repentance (For they, who have but lately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to make a ſtrict ſearch into themſelves, muſt of neceſſity be without it, how true ſoever their Repentance is) Though they ought not therefore, if they find no other reaſon to queſtion the truth of it, to condemn, or doubt of that their Repentance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe true Repentance muſt of neceſſity precede the Fruits of it: Yet I think they will act moſt ſafely for themſelves, and moſt for the comfort of their own Souls, I do not ſay, if they ſtay ſo long from the participation of this Sacrament, till they can have the Fruits of their Repentance to juſtifie the ſincerity thereof, but if, when they may, they think betimes and often, what Repentance they are to bring with them to this Sacrament, and accordingly ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as early to improve what they have, and bring forth the fruits of it in thoſe inſtances, wherein they have been moſt pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, and are by their natural inclinations moſt likely to be ſo ſtill. For ſo they ſhall be able to ſee by the event, what the nature of their Repentance is, and accordingly be ſtirred up to labour after a more ſincere one, or be ſatisfied by the fruits they have brought forth, that they are <hi>ſo far</hi> duly qualified for the partaking of this ſo excellent a Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>Having ſaid thus much concerning the examination of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which I judge of all other things to be moſt neceſſary to be enquir'd into, I ſhall need to ſay the leſs concerning that, which follows, even the examination of our <hi>ſtedfaſt purpoſe to lead a new Life,</hi> as well as of the truth of our Repentance. For as it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from what hath been ſaid elſewhere<note n="(t)" place="margin">Part V.</note>, that that ought to be enquir'd into, becauſe the thing we are to make <hi>profeſſion</hi> of in the receit of this Sacrament; So he, who is ſatisfied of the truth of his Repentance by the fruits, which it hath produc'd, may by the ſame fruits ſatisfie himſelf of the ſtedfaſtneſs of his preſent Purpoſe, to abandon his former ſins, and purſue the contrary Graces: There being no great likelihood of his departing from his preſent Purpoſe, who knows himſelf to have already produc'd thoſe good fruits which he now reſolves upon, as that too, out of the Conſcience of his own
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:56517:193"/>obligation to them, and the juſt ſenſe he hath of his former aberra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the Affront he offer'd to <hi>his</hi> both Authority, and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to whom he now devotes himſelf anew. Only, if any Man find not in himſelf this moſt ſure proof of the ſtedfaſtneſs of his Purpoſe, and yet find in himſelf a diſpoſition thus to ſhew forth his Saviour's death, and a deſire to partake of the ſeveral Graces, and Benefits of this Sacrament; Let him ſee whether he can by his own earneſt Prayers, and reflections, and God's Bleſſing upon them both, bring himſelf to reſolve as well againſt the particular ways, and means, whereby he was formerly train'd into ſin, as againſt the ſin it ſelf, and upon ſuch particular ways, and means alſo, whereby it is moſt certainly prevented. For ſo I do not ſee why he ſhould not look upon his Reſolution as ſtedfaſt, and ſuch as God will both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of in the preſent caſe, and add farther ſtrength to by the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of this Sacrament: thoſe Reſolutions, which prove in the event to be uncertain, and tottering, being for the moſt part only general ones, and ſuch as deſcend not to thoſe particular ways, and means, whereby men come to be enſnar'd, or whereby that ſeduction of theirs may be certainly prevented Thus, for inſtance, if a Man, who hath heretofore given himſelf more liberty in drinking, than the Laws of Temperance will allow, ſhould reflect ſo far upon his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer failings this way, as not only to reſolve againſt the like intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance for the future, but againſt ſuch Company too, ſo far as he may, by which he hath been drawn into it, or to keep however within ſuch meaſures, that there can be no danger for him of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I do not ſee why that Man may not look upon ſuch a Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as a ſtedfaſt one, and which God, the giver of all Grace, will add farther firmneſs, and ſtedfaſtneſs to, and make it hold out, even againſt thoſe temptations, which at preſent it may be, it is not in a condition to grapple with.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Catechiſm</hi> goes on to tell us, That we ought to examine our ſelves in the third place, whether we have <hi>a lively faith in God's mercy through Chriſt;</hi> As well it way, when he, who was the Inſtitutor of this Sacrament, prompts us to receive the Elements thereof as that <hi>Body</hi> of his, which was broken for us, and as that <hi>Blood,</hi> which was ſhed for the remiſſion of our ſins: That, as it ſuppoſeth that we ought to look upon the mercy of God, as convey'd to us by Chriſt's death, and accordingly expect that mercy by it, and truſt upon that death for it, which is that our Church underſtands by <hi>Faith</hi>
                        <note n="(u)" place="margin">See Expl. of Bapt. Part 10.</note>, ſo ſuppoſing too, that we ought to approach this Sacrament with ſuch a ſorrow for ſin, and reſolution againſt it, as ſo great a Benefit requires, which will convert this Faith, or truſt into a <hi>lively,</hi> and operative one. Now whether we have ſuch a lively Faith, or no, we may eaſily ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie our ſelves by its being attended, or not attended with that ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and reſolution, and which how they are to be known, I have already accounted for.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall hardly need to ſay any thing concerning examining our ſelves in the fourth place, whether we have <hi>a thankful remembrance of</hi> Chriſt's <hi>death.</hi> Partly, becauſe that thankful remembrance is one of the principal things enjoin'd in the celebration of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and we therefore to bring that with us to the due recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:56517:193"/>of it; And partly, becauſe it will not be difficult for us to diſcover, whether we have ſuch a Remembrance, or no: That being to be judg'd in part by our own deſire of receiving the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Sacrament, but more by the care we take to prepare our ſelves for it, as by other ways, and means, ſo by an earneſt reflection upon the Benefits of that Death, which this Sacrament was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to commemorate. For he, who carefully reflects upon that Death, will find enough in it to incite him to a thankful remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of it, yea, to intend it with all his might, when he receives the Sacrament thereof.</p>
                     <p>But of all the things, which we ought to examine our ſelves about, when we think of approaching this moſt holy Sacrament, nothing certainly more imports us to enquire, than <hi>whether we are in Charity with all Men,</hi> as our <hi>Catechiſm</hi> expreſſeth it, and particularly with thoſe, that are <hi>of the ſame Houſhold of Faith.</hi> For one great deſign of this Holy Sacrament<note n="(w)" place="margin">Part 5.</note> being to teſtifie our <hi>Communion</hi> with one another, and with all, that are of the ſame holy Family, it can be no other than a flat contradiction to it, to come to this Holy Sacrament without ſo neceſſary a Grace. But becauſe what the peculiar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of this Grace are, and what particular actions it obligeth to, is more proper for the diſcuſſion of thoſe, who intreat <hi>de induſtriâ</hi> of this, and other preparatories to this Sacrament, than for a general diſcourſe concerning them; It ſhall ſuffice me to admoniſh, that to be in charity with all Men, and particularly with all Chriſtians, is to have a Mind ready to oblige all Men, that ſhall ſtand in need of our aſſiſtance, with ſuch ſupplies as we are able to afford them, whether of our Prayers, or Purſes, or Endeavours; That we ought much more, if we pretend to any thing of that Grace, to be free from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them any juſt offence, and as willing, and ready to make amends for it, if we are conſcious to our ſelves of it; That if others break this moſt excellent band of Charity with us, yet we do not imitate them therein, nor return railing for railing, but contrariwiſe, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; That we be as ready to forgive injuries, as to paſs by affronts, and actually do ſo, where the injury may be born, but however where the offending Perſon returns, and repents; That, when ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity obligeth us to ſeek a ſatisfaction, we rather ſeek a ſatisfaction for the damage we ſuſtain, than of our own vindictive humour, and purſue our ſatisfaction by ſuch ways, and means, as are rather neceſſary for us, than vexatious to them; In fine (which is the ſum of all, and is perhaps the moſt uſeful, as well as the moſt general advice, that can be given in this Affair) that we ſhew forth ſuch cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to others, as we our ſelves would expect in the like Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, or ſhall look for from God, and Chriſt at the great day of retribution. Which it will not be difficult to bring our ſelves to, if we reflect as we ought upon the inſtances God gives us even now of his immenſe love toward us, or the need we ſhall ſtand in at the laſt day of a far greater Charity, how careful ſoever we are to approve our ſelves unto him. And I ſhall only add for the ſake of thoſe, who may perhaps be dazled with ſo glorious a Light, the reſolution of two Caſes, which I have met with in the courſe of my Miniſtry, and which others, it may be, may be as much ſtagger'd by. Whereof
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:56517:194"/>the former reſpects the Love of Enemies, the other that perfect Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which our <hi>Liturgy</hi>
                        <note n="(x)" place="margin">Exhort. to the Commun.</note> ſeems to require of all that approach this Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>It is ſometime thought by well-meaning Perſons, for want of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the true nature of the Love of Enemies, that the Love, which we ought to have for them, ought not only to be ſuch, as will diſpoſe us to pray for them, and do good to them, but ſuch as will alike diſpoſe us to take them into our boſom, or at leaſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with them with that freedom, and chearfulneſs, as we do with other Men, with whom we have had no ſuch difference. Which Love therefore, whilſt the foremention'd perſons find not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they begin to think they are ſo far forth without that Charity, which is requiſite for the Communion, and upon that account ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude themſelves from it. And I willingly grant that their ſcruple were reaſonable enough, if they had to do with ſuch Enemies, as had return'd, and repented, and given them due proofs of it. For not to admit ſuch perſons into their former ſtate at leaſt, is in truth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſome part of our diſpleaſure againſt them, and conſequently, not ſo much as to forgive them perfectly, but however not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them, as we deſire, and expect to be forgiven by God. But that we ſhould have ſuch a Love as this for Enemies, continuing ſuch, is a very great miſtake, and ſuch as not only, no Law of Chriſt requires, but no example of God, or Chriſt doth. For the clearing whereof we are to diſtinguiſh of a twofold Love, whereof the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer for diſtinction ſake, may be call'd a Love of Complacency, and Delight, the other a Love of good Will, and Compaſſion. I call that a Love of Complacency, and Delight, which is between Friends, and ſuch as diſpoſeth them to deſire, and delight in each others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, or to be troubled at the want of it; Whilſt that of good will, and compaſſion prompts us only to deſire, and endeavour the good of thoſe we have to do with. Now as the former of theſe is the Love, that is now in queſtion, becauſe deſcrib'd as ſuch as diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth us to take Men into our boſom, or at leaſt to converſe with them, with the ſame freedom, and chearfulneſs, as we would do with thoſe, with whom we have no ſuch difference; So we are not in the leaſt to think that any ſuch Love is due to Enemies, becauſe having nothing in them to engage it, but rather to ſtir up an averſation for them. And we may know it more perfectly from hence, that God, by whoſe example we are taught to love our Enemies, doth not ſo love his, even the evil, and unjuſt. His delight is in his Saints, and ſuch as are after his own Heart, both in the Piety of their Minds, and the Holineſs of their Lives. But for the evil, and the unjuſt, whilſt they continue ſuch, he rather hates, and abhorrs them, and indeed, conſidering the Purity of his Nature, cannot be ſuppoſed to do otherwiſe. Only as the hatred he bears to ſuch perſons, hinders him not however from deſiring their welfare, and purſuing it, that ſo he may make them his Friends, and love them as ſuch; So that that is all the Love, which either he himſelf ſhews to his Enemies, or requires of us, is evident from thoſe very Scriptures, which profeſs to give an account of that Love of his, and of our imitation of it: They repreſenting it as ſuch a Love, as diſpoſeth him to cauſe his
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:56517:194"/>Sun to ariſe on the evil, and the good,<note n="(y)" place="margin">Mat. 5.45.</note> and to ſend Rain on the juſt, and unjuſt. Which Love of Enemies therefore, if we comply with, we have all that God can be thought to require of us, I do not ſay by his Precepts, but even by his own bleſſed Example.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe ſome perſons, as they conceive, find in themſelves ſome indiſpoſition, even to this latter ſort of Love, becauſe not exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the acts of it with that pleaſure wherewith they ſhould, though at the ſame time, as they themſelves confeſs, they are infinitely trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at it, and both pray, and ſtrive againſt that their indiſpoſition; And becauſe they look upon that their indiſpoſition, as irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable with that perfect Charity, which our <hi>Liturgy</hi> mentions, and which, as they think, the Scripture requires<note n="(z)" place="margin">Mat. 5.48.</note>, when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to be <hi>perfect, as our heavenly Father is perfect;</hi> Therefore I think it not amiſs to add, That Charity may be ſaid to be perfect two manner of ways, To wit, either as excluding all wilful uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableneſs, or as excluding alſo involuntary averſations, or diſguſts. In the former ſenſe there is no doubt, every Man ought to be in perfect Charity, neither is there any thing in the former Caſe to perſwade, that the perſons before deſcribed are not. For they certainly, who do not only exert the proper acts of Love, but are troubled that they cannot do it more readily, and chearfully, have nothing of wilful, or affected uncharitableneſs in them. All that is to be ſaid of ſuch perſons, is, that their Charity is not ſo perfect as to exclude all involuntary averſations, or diſguſts. Which, who hath, or can have, where there is ſuch a thing as Fleſh, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and between which, the Scripture tells us, there will be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Combat? It is enough, and, perhaps, as much as can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from us, to ſtrive againſt thoſe natural riſings of our own Hearts, and ſo, as to do thoſe things, which Charity requires of us, notwithſtanding them; Being moreover troubled that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do what we do more chearfully, and readily, and both asking God pardon for it, and deſiring a farther aſſiſtance of his Grace in order to it. Which, as they are the qualifications of the perſons before deſcrib'd, ſo ſeem to me, to be a better proof of the truly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable temper of the Parties, than they dare challenge to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Becauſe I do not ſee how any one can both do the things, which Charity requires of him, and lament his not more chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performing them, if he had not in him a ſincere, though imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Charity toward thoſe, that are the Objects of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I have little to return by way of Anſwer, to what is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd in the ſecond place, concerning our Demeanour at the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of this Sacrament; Unleſs it be that <hi>Hoc age,</hi> which the old <hi>Romans</hi> premis'd to the offering of their reſpective Sacrifices. For then ſhall we demean our ſelves, as we ought, at the Celebration of this Sacrament, when we make our thoughts, and affections go along with the Prieſt's words, and actions, neither ſuffer any thing, how uſeful ſoever, to poſſeſs our Minds, which they do not ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt to us.: Becauſe as the whole of that Service was intended for our Inſtruction, and Edification, ſo the main of it conſiſts of ſuch Prayers, and Praiſes, as are offer'd up in our name, and which therefore we cannot expect the benefit of, unleſs our Thoughts, and
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:56517:195" rendition="simple:additions"/>Affections ſay an <hi>Amen</hi> to them all the way, as well as our Voice doth at the concluſion of them. If the diſtribution of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Elements leaves any void places for our private Devotions (as it cannot well do otherwiſe, where there is any number to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of them) they are, and may be ſo fill'd up with thoſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and Ejaculations, which our printed <hi>Manuals</hi> of Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons furniſh, that it will be in vain for me to offer any thing toward the ſupplying of them. Only amidſt thoſe tranſports of joy, and thankfulneſs, which the remembrance of Chriſt's Death, or our own Meditations upon it, may ſuggeſt unto us, let us not forget, that we meet together to <hi>oblige our ſelves by</hi> the preſent Sacrament, as well as to <hi>receive benefit</hi> from it, and accordingly, to vow to God, the abandoning of thoſe ſins, by which we have been hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore enſnar'd, and particularly our moſt beloved ones.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third, and laſt Queſtion remains to be diſcuſs'd, even in <hi>what poſture of Body,</hi> we ought to receive this holy Sacrament. A Queſtion, which I ſhould hardly have thought fit to propoſe, had not the <hi>ſingularity</hi> of ſome among our ſelves, repreſented the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of <hi>ſitting,</hi> as the only allowable one. I call it a Singularity, firſt, becauſe, ſo far as we can judge by their Writings, the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients</hi> always receiv'd it in a poſture of Adoration. And I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal for the proof hereof to <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> in the firſt place, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only one of the moſt Antient, but one too, who gives the moſt accurate account of this Solemnity. For though it be true, that that <hi>Father</hi> makes no expreſs mention of the poſture, wherein this Sacrament was receiv'd; Yet as he takes particular notice of the whole Aſſemblies <hi>riſing up</hi> to Prayers after the reading of the Scriptures, and the Biſhop's Exhortation out of them, ſo he takes no notice at all of their changing their poſture afterwards, either in the Service of the Euchariſt, or the diſtribution, or reception of it. Which is to me a probable Argument, that they continued in the ſame poſture, and conſequently receiv'd the Sacrament in it. And indeed, as it is not to be thought, that they ſhould uſe any leſs reverent poſture in the Prayers, and Thankſgivings of this Sacrament, than they did in the Prayers, that preceded it, which ſhews that ſo far, to be ſure, they continued ſtill in the poſture of <hi>ſtanding;</hi> So that Father's ſubjoining immediately to that Service, that the <hi>Deacons</hi> thereupon gave, or diſtributed the Elements ſo bleſs'd, to each of thoſe, that were preſent, and carried them away to thoſe, that were abſent, makes it farther probable, that they, who were to communicate, did not come up to the Table, and there ſit, and receive with the Preſident, or Biſhop, which they muſt have done, if they had kept to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture now contended for, but continu'd where they were before, and in the ſame reverential Poſture, wherein they but now were at Prayers. For to imagine them <hi>ſitting</hi> in their proper places, and ſo receiving, is not only without any the leaſt ground in that <hi>Father,</hi> but without any ground alſo from the reaſon of that poſture in the Sacrament, even its being, as they tell us, the poſture of a <hi>Feaſt.</hi> For how doth it agree to a Feaſt, for thoſe, that are invited to it, not to approach that Table, upon which
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:56517:195" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Feaſt is ſet, or at leaſt ſome other, that is placed near to it.

                        <hi>in this particular.</hi> All which things conſider'd, it will appear, that, if they among us, who advance <hi>ſitting</hi> at the Sacrament, be not therefore guilty of <hi>ſingularity,</hi> yet they muſt be for advancing it as the <hi>only allowable</hi> one, as if their Reaſons were good, they muſt be thought to do.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe how ſingular ſoever this Opinion of theirs may be, yet it is pretended, that it hath Chriſt, and his Diſciples example on its ſide, together with the ſuffrage of Reaſon; Therefore it will be but juſt to examine thoſe Pretences, and ſee what there is of ſtrength in them.</p>
                     <p>And firſt it is pretended, that our Saviour Chriſt, and his Diſciples ſat at the receiving of this Sacrament, or at leaſt, us'd ſuch a poſture, as was anſwerable to <hi>ſitting</hi> among us, even lying along upon Beds, as the faſhion of thoſe Countries was. And it is not to be denied, that there is ſufficient ground from the Scripture, for their uſing that Poſture at the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> and not unlikely neither, that they held it on at the Celebration of the Lord's Supper. But will it therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that we ought to look upon no other Poſture than that, or one of the ſame nature, as allowable? For beſide that things, which are but probable, may be falſe, and things, improbable, true; Beſide that things probable, for that very reaſon, cannot conclude the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of any Man, and ought much leſs to be made uſe of to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Conſciences of others; If Chriſt, and his Diſciples practice in this particular, were as certain, as it is ſuppoſed to be probable, yet could it not be of force to conclude ours, unleſs there were ſome <hi>Command</hi> to oblige us to follow it, or ſome <hi>cogent Reaſon</hi> in the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice it ſelf, to ſhew the neceſſity thereof: Becauſe Example, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd in it ſelf, is no Rule of humane Actions, in as much as it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhews what others have done before us, than what we our ſelves are to do in any Affair. Which is ſo true, as to that very Example, which we have now before us, that they, who inſiſt upon it in the <hi>poſture of receiving,</hi> do yet without any heſitancy depart from it in other Circumſtances, and ſuch too, as are more certain than the poſture of receiving is. For they, no more than we, think themſelves oblig'd to receive either in the <hi>Evening,</hi> or in an <hi>upper Room,</hi> or in unleavened Bread, all which Chriſt, and his Diſciples muſt be acknowledg'd to have done in that Supper, which he cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated with them. But therefore, as if they will have this Example of Chriſt and his Diſciples, to be obligatory, they muſt find out ſome <hi>Command</hi> obliging us to follow it, or ſome <hi>cogent Reaſon</hi> in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it ſelf to ſhew the neceſſity thereof; So, if we ſtay till that be done, we may ſtay long enough, becauſe there is no juſt Pretence
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:56517:196" rendition="simple:additions"/>for the one, or the other of them. For what ſhadow is there, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, of any Command to follow Chriſt, or his Diſciples Example in this, as there is for the <hi>taking</hi> of the Sacramental Elements, and <hi>eating,</hi> or <hi>drinking</hi> of them? Unleſs they ſhould perhaps urge the Command of, <hi>Do this,</hi> as a Command that extends to the <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi> of the things then done, or enjoin'd, as well as to the <hi>Actions</hi> themſelves. But beſide, that the words, <hi>Do this,</hi> do in their own nature referr rather to the <hi>things</hi> then done, or enjoin'd, than to the Circumſtances thereof; If the words, <hi>Do this,</hi> extend to the <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi> of the things then done or enjoin'd, as well as to the <hi>things</hi> themſelves, they muſt alike extend to the <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>place,</hi> wherein this Sacrament was celebrated, and to the <hi>quality</hi> of that <hi>Bread,</hi> wherewith it was. Which when we ſhall ſee them alike inſiſt upon, we ſhall think of another Anſwer, but till then acquieſce in this. If there be any thing to make the poſture of our Saviour, and his Diſciples to be obligatory, it muſt be ſome <hi>cogent Reaſon</hi> in the practice it ſelf, to ſhew the neceſſity thereof.</p>
                     <p>And indeed, as the advancers of this Poſture, are forc'd to come to this at length, which ſhews how weakly our Saviour, and his Diſciples meer Example is urg'd in this Affair; So they think they have reaſon enough on their ſide, becauſe the poſture of <hi>ſitting,</hi> is more proper for the Lord's Supper, than any other poſture is. I will not now ſay, though I might, that if that poſture be only more proper, than any other, there may be place upon occaſion for other poſtures beſide that, which ſhews it, even in their own Opinion, not to be the only proper, or neceſſary one; But I ſay, that it cannot be concluded to be the more proper one in the preſent inſtance, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the <hi>Supper of the Lord</hi> were of the ſame nature with <hi>common</hi> ones, or at leaſt, with that of the <hi>Paſchal Lamb,</hi> the Deſign whereof was to feed the Bellies of its Gueſts, as well as the deſires of their Souls. Now is there any thing in the Lord's Supper, that looks that way? Nay, doth not the inſtituting of it, after that of the Paſchal Lamb, proclaim the contrary, and direct Men to look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſpiritual Satisfaction, rather than a natural one? And may Men then preſcribe Rules to <hi>ſuch</hi> a Feaſt, from the <hi>modes</hi> of thoſe of another nature? Or, becauſe <hi>ſitting</hi> is moſt ſuitable to thoſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it is alſo ſuch to this? Would not one rather think (if we ſpeak only of more, or leſs proper) that ſome other poſture would be more proper for <hi>this Feaſt,</hi> even ſuch a one, as doth more beſpeak the reverence of thoſe, that are invited to feaſt with, and upon ſo great a Perſon as Chriſt? Eſpecially, when one great Reaſon of its Inſtitution was to expreſs by the receit of it the grateful Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance we have of the ineſtimable Benefits of his Death? And I know of nothing, that can be replied againſt this way of Reaſoning, unleſs it be the preſumption there is, that Chriſt, who certainly knew what was moſt proper in this Affair, gave it to his Diſciples <hi>ſitting,</hi> or <hi>lying along.</hi> For if he thought the ordinary poſture of a Feaſt to be the moſt proper, why ſhould we repreſent another as ſuch, unleſs we would be wiſer than he that inſtituted it? And I no way doubt, ſuppoſing our Saviour to have given it to his Diſciples in the ordinary poſture of a Feaſt, that he thought it the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:56517:197"/>at that time, and that we muſt have always look'd upon it as ſuch, if he had enjoin'd the uſe of it for the time to come. But doth it therefore follow, though there be no ſuch Precept for it, that we ought always to look upon it as ſuch? Or think, becauſe it was then the moſt proper one, that it muſt ever be ſo? For poſſibly the making uſe of that poſture then, was not ſo much out of a Belief of its being in it ſelf the moſt proper one, but more proper for that time, and place, becauſe more agreeable to the Ceremonies of that <hi>Solemnity,</hi> from which this Sacrament was borrowed, and where it appears from <hi>Paulus Fagius</hi>
                        <note n="(k)" place="margin">Liturgic. Caſſand. in initio.</note>, That the Father of the Family, and his Gueſts ſat, or lay down to Meat, before he either bleſs'd, or they receiv'd that Euchariſt from him. Poſſibly alſo, though Chriſt, and his Diſciples lay along during that whole Action, yet they did otherwiſe expreſs, whether by the bowing the Head, or lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their Eyes, the regard they had to that God, by Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to whom that Solemnity was begun: I do not ſay only, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was intended as a Sacrifice of Praiſe to God, for the bleſſing of our Redemption, but becauſe it was intended alſo to ſhew it forth to others, and excite them to the ſame grateful, and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Remembrance of it, and of his Death, by whom it was to be accompliſhed; That being not very advantageouſly to be done, where the poſture of receiving the Symbols of it is not at leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termix'd with ſomething, that hath in it a different Air from that of an ordinary Feaſt. Which ſuppos'd, it will not be difficult to ſhew in what poſture of Body this Sacrament ought to be receiv'd. For, for ought that I can ſee by the very nature of the Sacrament it ſelf, and the practice of the Antients, a poſture of Adoration is the moſt proper for the receit of it, and, as ſuch, to be preferr'd before any other whatſoever. That provided the poſture made uſe of, be a poſture of Adoration, it matters not in it ſelf, what kind of one is made choice of, becauſe there is no Command for any particular one. That both <hi>ſtanding,</hi> and <hi>kneeling,</hi> therefore muſt be look'd upon as proper ones, becauſe both of them poſtures of Adoration, and as ſuch, accordingly made uſe of in ſeveral Ages of the Church, and by ſeveral Churches of the ſame. That by how much the more any poſture is remov'd from a poſture of Adoration, ſo much the more improper is it for the receit of this Sacrament, and that <hi>ſitting</hi> at it therefore, is of all others, the moſt unſuitable one. In fine, that if <hi>ſitting</hi> were more proper, than indeed it is, yet being not under any Divine Command, it ought in reaſon to give place to that poſture, which hath the general practice of the Church to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant it, and the particular Commands of thoſe, whom God himſelf hath obliged us to obey.</p>
